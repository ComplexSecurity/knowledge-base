The `password_hash()` function in [PHP](../programming/php.md) is a built-in function designed for creating a secure hash of a password. It is an important tool in PHP for implementing user authentication systems in a secure manner. This function simplifies the process of securely hashing passwords, which is crucial for protecting user passwords against unauthorized access, particularly in the event of a data breach.

By default, `password_hash()` uses the [BCrypt](../cryptography/bcrypt.md) algorithm, which is currently considered a strong option for password hashing. It automatically handles tasks like generating and applying a [salt](../security/salt.md) (a random string added to the password before hashing to prevent [rainbow table attacks](../security/rainbows.md)).

The function allows you to specify a cost factor, which determines how computationally expensive the hash operation is. A higher cost factor makes the hashing process slower, which helps to protect against [brute-force attacks](../security/brute.md).

The resulting hash includes information about the algorithm used, the cost factor, and the salt. This self-contained format makes it easy to store and verify passwords. An example of using it is:

```php
$password = "user_password";
$hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
// Store $hash in the database
```

When storing user passwords, you would save the hash generated by `password_hash()`, not the plain password.

The use of bcrypt and a cost factor increases the difficulty of brute-force attacks, as each password guess would require significant computational time. Automatic salting prevents the effective use of precomputed rainbow tables for [password cracking](../security/crack.md).

As security standards evolve, functions like `password_hash()` are updated in newer versions of PHP, helping developers adhere to current best practices with minimal effort. `password_hash()` abstracts the complexities of secure password storage, reducing the likelihood of implementation errors that could compromise security.
