libxml_disable_entity_loader is a function in [[PHP]] used to disable the ability to load external entities in libxml, which is the library PHP uses for parsing [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]]. This function is particularly relevant for preventing [[XML External Entities (XXE)]] attacks in PHP applications.

The main purpose of `libxml_disable_entity_loader` is to prevent libxml from loading external entities, which is a common attack vector in XXE attacks. By default, libxml in PHP may load external entities specified in an XML document, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

A basic example of using it may be:

```php
// Disable the ability to load external entities
libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);

// Load an XML document (without loading any external entities)
$xml = simplexml_load_string($xmlString);

// Re-enable the ability to load external entities if needed
libxml_disable_entity_loader(false);
```

Before loading an XML string with `simplexml_load_string`, the loading of external entities is disabled to prevent XXE attacks.

When `libxml_disable_entity_loader` is set to `true`, it effectively mitigates the risk of XXE attacks, which can lead to information disclosure, data exfiltration, or [[server-side request forgery]]. In PHP 8.0 and newer, `libxml_disable_entity_loader` has been deprecated, as it no longer affects libxml's entity loader behavior, which is now safe by default. In PHP 7.3 and earlier, where the function isnâ€™t deprecated, it's crucial to use it to secure XML processing.

While `libxml_disable_entity_loader` helps secure XML processing against XXE attacks, it's also important to ensure that all user-supplied XML data is properly validated and sanitized.
