`window.location` in [JavaScript](../programming/js.md) is an object that contains information about the current URL and provides methods to change it. It's part of the `window` object, which represents the browser window or tab.

The `window.location` object includes properties like `href` (the full URL), `hostname` (domain name), `pathname` (the path after the domain name), `protocol` (such as 'http:' or 'https:'), and `search` (the query string).

You can also use `window.location` to redirect the user to another page by setting `window.location.href` to a new URL. For instance, `window.location.href = 'https://www.example.com'` would redirect the user to '[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)'. This object is widely used in web development for tasks related to navigation and URL manipulation.
