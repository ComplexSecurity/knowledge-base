C# (pronounced "C Sharp") is a modern, [[Object-Oriented Programming]] language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. C# has evolved to become one of the most widely used programming languages. It is used for a variety of software applications ranging from web development to desktop and mobile applications, and even game development.

C# is fundamentally object-oriented, meaning it supports concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Initially designed for the [[DotNet Framework|.NET Framework]], C# is now also a primary language for .NET Core, a cross-platform, open-source framework. It allows C# applications to run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

C# is a strongly typed language, enforcing strict type-checking at compile time. This helps to catch errors early in the development process and enhances code quality and maintainability. The syntax of C# is similar to other C-style languages such as [[Java]] and [[C++]]. It was influenced by these languages but includes many unique features.

C# comes with a vast standard library, .NET class library, which provides rich functionalities and helps in building robust applications quickly. C# is often used in conjunction with Visual Studio, a powerful IDE from Microsoft, which provides a comprehensive environment for development, debugging, and testing.

C# is used for developing a wide range of applications including web applications (using [[ASP.NET]]), Windows desktop applications, mobile applications (via Xamarin), and even games (using Unity).

C# benefits from a large developer community and a wide ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. It is continuously updated and maintained by Microsoft. C# manages memory automatically through a garbage collector, which frees up memory used by objects that are no longer in use.
