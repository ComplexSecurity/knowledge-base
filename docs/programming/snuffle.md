Snuffleupagus is a security module for [PHP](../programming/php.md), primarily designed to strengthen the security of PHP applications by providing powerful and flexible protection mechanisms against various kinds of attacks. It's often used as a modern alternative to older tools like [Suhosin](../misc/suhosin.md) or [Hardening-Patch](../security/hard.md), offering a more up-to-date approach to securing PHP environments.

It allows administrators to virtually patch vulnerabilities in their PHP applications without modifying the actual code. This is particularly useful for addressing security issues in third-party code or when immediate code fixes are not feasible. 

It also provides various configurations to mitigate common vulnerabilities and attack techniques, such as [SQL injection](../security/sqli.md), [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](../security/rce.md), [Local File Inclusion (LFI)](../security/rfi.md), and others. Admins can write custom rules to tailor the security settings to their specific environment and needs. These rules can block, allow, or log certain PHP functions and behaviors based on configurable criteria.

It offers robust logging features, helping administrators monitor and respond to potential security incidents. It also strengthens the PHP setup by hardening various configuration settings, reducing the attack surface of PHP applications.

Snuffleupagus is part of a defense-in-depth strategy, adding an additional layer of security to PHP applications. Its ability to enforce flexible and powerful security policies makes it a valuable tool for protecting against zero-day vulnerabilities and other emerging threats.

Snuffleupagus is installed as a PHP extension and requires configuration through its specific syntax. The configuration process involves creating rules that define what actions to take when certain conditions are met in PHP code execution.
