Visual Basic (VB) is a programming language and development environment created by Microsoft. It's known for its simplicity and ease of use, particularly in building Windows-based applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Visual Basic played a significant role in popularizing event-driven programming and visual rapid application development (RAD) in the 1990s.

Visual Basic was one of the first tools to provide a rapid application development (RAD) environment, allowing developers to quickly build and prototype Windows applications using a drag-and-drop interface for UI elements.

VB popularized the concept of event-driven programming. In VB, code is generally executed in response to various events, such as button clicks or user actions. One of Visual Basic's strengths was its ease of use, making programming accessible to a broader range of people, including those without a formal computer science background.

VB is based on the BASIC programming language (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), known for its simplicity. VB extended BASIC with object-oriented features and a powerful set of tools for interface design.

VB came with an integrated development environment (IDE), which included a code editor, a debugger, and a GUI editor. VB made heavy use of the Component Object Model, which allowed for the integration of components and controls to enhance the functionality of applications.

With the advent of the [.NET framework](../frameworks/dotnetf.md), Microsoft introduced VB.NET, which brought Visual Basic into the .NET ecosystem, offering a more modern, object-oriented version of the language. VB was commonly used for developing database-driven applications, offering straightforward methods for database integration and manipulation.
