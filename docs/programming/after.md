The [jQuery](../programming/jquery.md) after() function is used to insert content after the selected elements in the [Document Object Model](../web/dom.md) (DOM). This method provides a convenient way to add new content or elements to your webpage dynamically.

The after() function can take a string, [HTML](../web/http.md) element, array of elements, or jQuery object as an argument. The provided content is then inserted right after each element in the set of matched elements:

```javascript
$(selector).after(content);
```

Where:

- selector - jQuery selector that identifies the elements after which the new content will be inserted
- content - the content to be inserted, can be HTML strings, DOM objects or other jQuery objects

An example could be:

```javascript
$("p").after("<span> New content</span>");
```

This will insert the <span\>New content</span\> after every <p\> element in the document. The after() method can also take multiple arguments to insert multiple elements in sequence:

```javascript
$("p").after("<span>First</span>", "<span>Second</span>");
```

Be cautious when inserting content from untrusted sources to prevent [Cross-Site Scripting](../web/xss.md) (XSS) vulnerabilities. Always sanitize external input before including it in the DOM.
