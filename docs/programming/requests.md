The `requests` module in [[Python]] is a popular [[HTTP Protocol|HTTP]] library used for making HTTP requests to web servers or [[APIs]]. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests, handling responses, and interacting with web services. Unlike the lower-level `http.client` library built into Python, `requests` provides a more user-friendly and higher-level interface.

The module offers a straightforward way to send HTTP requests. You can perform GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other request types with minimal code. It makes it easy to access response data. You can retrieve the status code, response headers, and the response body. It also automatically decodes the response content based on its headers.

Sending URL parameters and request payloads (like form data or [[JavaScript Object Notation|JSON]]) is straightforward. The module allows you to pass these elements as simple Python dictionaries. You can easily customize request headers and add authentication (basic, digest, or custom) to your requests.

For maintaining state across requests (like cookies), you can use session objects which persist certain parameters across requests. The module automatically processes and stores cookies sent by the server and sends them back with subsequent requests.

By default, `requests` verifies [[SSL]] certificates for [[HTTPS Protocol|HTTPS]] requests, which is important for secure communication. You can set timeouts on your requests to ensure that your script doesn’t hang indefinitely if the server doesn’t respond. The module automatically handles HTTP redirections (like 301 and 302 status codes).

While the `requests` module itself is secure, the way it is used can have security implications. For instance, disabling SSL certificate verification (`verify=False`) can expose the request to [[Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack|man-in-the-middle attacks]]. It's also important to be cautious with the data you send and receive, especially when interacting with unknown or untrusted services.
