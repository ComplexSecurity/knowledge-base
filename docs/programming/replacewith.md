The [jQuery](../programming/jquery.md) replaceWith function is used to replace each element in the set of matched elements with new content. It's a component of the jQuery library, a comprehensive tool for [HTML](../web/html.md) [DOM](../web/dom.md) tree traversal, manipulation, event handling, and creating animations.

replaceWith replaces matched elements with the specified new content. This content can be HTML text, a DOM element, a jQuery object, or content returned by a function. The syntax is:

```javascript
$(selector).replaceWith(newContent)
```

- selector: Identifies the elements to be replaced using a jQuery selector.
- newContent: The new content that will replace the selected elements.

A usage example may be:

```javascript
$('#oldElement').replaceWith('<div>New Content</div>');
```

This example replaces the element with ID '**oldElement**' with a new div element containing 'New Content'.

The jQuery replaceWith function, like other DOM manipulation methods, can have security implications, especially concerning [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](../web/xss.md) attacks. These concerns primarily arise when the function is used with content that is dynamically generated or influenced by user input or data from untrusted sources.
