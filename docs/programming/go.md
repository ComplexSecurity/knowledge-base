The Go programming language, often referred to as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It's known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrency and networking. Go is statically typed and compiles to machine code, which contributes to its performance benefits.

An example program:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

    This example demonstrates a basic Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It uses the `fmt` package for formatted I/O operations.


Additionally, here is an example of concurrent [[HTTP Protocol|HTTP]] requests:

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func fetch(url string) {
    _, err := http.Get(url)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Fetched:", url)
}

func main() {
    urls := []string{
        "https://www.google.com",
        "https://www.example.com",
    }
    for _, url := range urls {
        go fetch(url)
    }
}
```

This snippet shows how Go can handle concurrent operations, like making multiple HTTP requests simultaneously. The `go` keyword is used to start a new goroutine, Go's lightweight thread, for each HTTP request.

Go's simplicity in syntax and powerful built-in features for handling concurrency make it a popular choice for server-side applications, cloud and network services, and command-line tools.
