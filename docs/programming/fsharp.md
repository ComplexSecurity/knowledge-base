F# (pronounced "F sharp") is a functional-first programming language that also supports imperative and [Object-Oriented Programming](../programming/oop.md) paradigms. It is a .NET language, meaning it runs on the Microsoft [.NET Framework](../frameworks/dotnetf.md) and .NET Core, and it was developed by Microsoft Research and later made open source. 

F# is known for its concise syntax, strong type system, and focus on functional programming.

F# is designed with a focus on functional programming techniques. It encourages immutable data, first-class functions, and expression-oriented programming, which can lead to more predictable and less error-prone code.

F# uses type inference to deduce the types of values and expressions without explicit type annotations. This leads to cleaner, more concise code while still providing the benefits of a strong static type system.

The syntax of F# is succinct and expressive, allowing developers to write less code compared to many other languages, without sacrificing readability or functionality. 

As a .NET language, F# can easily interoperate with other .NET languages like [C#](../programming/csharp.md) and [VB.NET](../programming/vbnet.md). It can use the extensive .NET libraries and frameworks, and F# code can be used in other .NET applications.

F# has strong support for asynchronous programming and parallel computations, making it well-suited for tasks involving I/O operations, computations on multicore processors, and [cloud computing](../cloud/cc.md).
