DOM.innerHTML is a property in the [Document Object Model (DOM)](../web/dom.md) of web development that is used to get or set the [HTML](../web/html.md) content of an element. It's a powerful feature that allows developers to dynamically manipulate web page content, but it also needs to be used with caution due to security implications.

When innerHTML is used to get the content of an element, it returns all the HTML inside that element as a string. This includes tags, text, and other elements:

```javascript
let content = document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML;
```

Above, "content" will contain the HTML markup within the element with the ID "myDiv".

When used to set the content of an element, innerHTML replaces the existing content of the element with the provided HTML string:

```javascript
document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "<p>New content</p>";
```

This will replace whatever is inside myDiv with <p\>New content</p\>.

The primary security concern with innerHTML is its susceptibility to [XSS](../web/xss.md) attacks. If innerHTML is used to set content based on user input or other untrusted sources without proper sanitization, it can lead to the execution of malicious scripts.

For example, if user-provided data is directly inserted using innerHTML, and that data contains a <script\> tag with malicious JavaScript, the script will be executed when the HTML is rendered.
