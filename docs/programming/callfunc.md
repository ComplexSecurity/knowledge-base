`call_user_func_array()` is a function in [[PHP]], a widely-used server-side scripting language for web development. This function is used to call a callback (a function or a method) with an array of parameters. It's particularly useful when you need to call a function and you don't know beforehand how many arguments will be passed to it.

The main purpose of `call_user_func_array()` is to call a user-defined function or a method of a class with a set of parameters that are passed in an array. The basic syntax of `call_user_func_array()` is as follows:

```php
mixed call_user_func_array ( callable $callback , array $param_arr )
```

- `$callback`: The function or method to be called. This can be a string containing the function name, an array containing an object and method name, or an anonymous function.
- `$param_arr`: An indexed array containing the parameters to be passed to the callback.

It returns the result of the function call. If the callback is not callable, it will issue a warning and return `FALSE`.

Here's an example to demonstrate how `call_user_func_array()` works:

```php
function sum($a, $b, $c) {
    return $a + $b + $c;
}

// Parameters to pass
$params = [1, 2, 3];

// Calling 'sum' function with parameters in '$params'
$result = call_user_func_array('sum', $params);

echo $result; // Outputs 6
```

In this example, `call_user_func_array()` is used to call the function `sum` with the parameters stored in the array `$params`.

`call_user_func_array()` is often used in scenarios where the number of parameters is not known until runtime, or when implementing call forwarding or proxy patterns in [[object-oriented programming]].

While `call_user_func_array()` is a powerful and flexible function, it should be used with caution, especially when dealing with user input. If the `$callback` or parameters are influenced by user input, it could lead to security vulnerabilities, such as [[Remote Code Execution]] (RCE) or [[Function Injection]] attacks. It's crucial to validate and sanitize any user input that might affect the function call.
