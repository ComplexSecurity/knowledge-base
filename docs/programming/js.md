JavaScript is a dynamic programming language commonly used in websites. It was originally used to make web pages more interactive but is now a core technology of the World Wide Web. It enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. It adds a bunch of features including:

- Client-Side Scripting - started as a way to add interactivity to web pages, things like button clicks, updating content dynamically, animating page elements and more.
- Server-Side Deployment - JS expanded into server-side allowing developers to build entire web apps using just JS.
- Event-Driven and Asynchronous - it can respond to events like mouse clicks or key presses. It also supports asynchronous operations enabling tasks like fetching data from a server without reloading the entire page.
- Dynamic - dynamically typed language, which means variable types are determined at runtime. This makes it flexible but also requires careful programming to avoid type-related bugs.
- Frameworks/Libraries - numerous JavaScript frameworks and libraries that provide pre-written JavaScript code to help developers build applications quickly and efficiently.
