CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for describing the presentation of a document written in [[HTML]] or XML. CSS makes websites look good. It is used to style and layout web pages - i.e. change font, colour, size, spacing, add columns, animations and many more.

It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. CSS can either be in the same [[HTML]] file or they can be stored externally in other CSS files.
