Java ME (Micro Edition) is a subset of the [[Java]] programming language specifically designed for embedded systems and consumer devices such as mobile phones, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), TV set-top boxes, and printers. 

Java ME provides a robust, flexible environment for applications running on embedded and mobile devices, with limited resources such as processing power and memory.

Java ME is optimized for devices with limited processing power, storage, and memory. It's a lightweight platform compared to [[Java SE (Standard Edition)]] and [[Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)|Java EE (Enterprise Edition)]].

Java ME is composed of configurations, profiles, and optional packages. Configurations (like CLDC - Connected Limited Device Configuration) provide a basic set of libraries and VM capabilities. Profiles (like MIDP - Mobile Information Device Profile) are built on configurations and add more specific functionalities.

Java ME was historically popular for mobile application development before the rise of smartphones and platforms like Android and iOS. It was used to develop applications (MIDlets) for feature phones. Applications written for Java ME are called MIDlets. They are packaged in [[Java Archive (JAR)|JAR]] files and use the [[Java Application Descriptor (JAD)]] files to describe the MIDletâ€™s properties.

Java ME runs on a scaled-down version of the JVM, which is tailored for devices with limited resources. It includes an [[APIs|API]] for user interface development, which, while less sophisticated than typical desktop APIs, is designed for the constraints of mobile devices. Java ME supports both networked applications and applications that can run offline.

Like other Java platforms, Java ME applications are written once and can run on any device that supports the Java ME platform, though specific device capabilities and limitations must be considered. With the advent of modern smartphone platforms like Android and iOS, the popularity of Java ME has significantly declined for mobile application development.
