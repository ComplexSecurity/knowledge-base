Rails is a development tool which gives web developers a framework, providing structure for all the code they write. The Rails framework helps developers to build websites and applications, because it abstracts and simplifies common repetitive tasks.

Rails is written in [[Ruby]], the programming language which is also used alongside Rails. Ruby is to Rails as PHP is to Symfony and Zend, or as [[Python]] is to [[Django]]. The appeal of Ruby to developers lies in the elegance and terseness of the language.

One of key principles of Ruby on Rails development (henceforth ‘Rails’) is convention over configuration. This means that the programmer does not have to spend a lot of time configuring files in order to get setup, Rails comes with a set of conventions which help speed up development.

Another characteristic of Rails is the emphasis on [[REST APIs|RESTful]] application design. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a style of software architecture based around the client-server relationship. It encourages a logical structure within applications, which means they can easily be exposed as an API (Application Programming Interface).

From project management point of view, the Ruby on Rails community advocate Agile web development - an iterative development method, that encourages collaborative and flexible approach, which is particularly well-suited for web application development with fast-changing requirements.
