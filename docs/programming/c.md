The C programming language is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. C has had a profound influence on the development of other programming languages and computing in general.

It's known for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability, making it popular for a wide range of applications, from operating systems to embedded systems.

C is a procedural language, meaning it follows a set of instructions in a sequence. It supports structured programming and allows for greater control over the flow of the program. C provides a balance between low-level and high-level programming. It allows for close manipulation of computer hardware with a relatively clear programming syntax, making it efficient in terms of both memory and processing power.

One of C's key features is its portability â€“ C programs written for one operating system can typically be easily adapted for another with minimal changes. C is extensively used in system software development. It's the language behind many operating systems, including Unix, which has influenced many other popular operating systems.

C comes with a standard library that includes a set of common functionalities such as I/O operations, string handling, mathematical functions, and utilities for memory management.

The syntax of C has influenced many other programming languages, including [[C++]], [[CSharp|C#]], [[Java]], and [[JavaScript]], among others.

C supports low-level operations using pointers, bit manipulation, and direct memory access, which are essential in system programming. C supports modularity, allowing complex applications to be broken down into simpler modules, which can then be compiled separately.
