The [[jQuery]] replaceAll() function is used to replace elements in the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) with new content. This function is part of the jQuery library, which is widely used for simplifying [[HTML]] DOM tree traversal and manipulation, handling events, and creating animations.

replaceAll() replaces the elements matched by the target selector with the elements specified by the calling selector. The syntax is:

```javascript
$(content).replaceAll(target)
```

- content - content or elements that will replace the target elements, can be HTML, a jQuery object, or a DOM element.
- target - target selector identifying elements to be replaced.

An example may be:

```javascript
$('<p>New Paragraph</p>').replaceAll('.old-paragraph');
```

Here, every element with the class '**old-paragraph**' is replaced by a new paragraph element.

The jQuery replaceAll function, like other DOM manipulation methods, can have security implications, particularly in relation to [[Cross-Site Scripting]] (XSS) attacks. These concerns arise primarily when dynamically generated content, especially content that includes user input or data from untrusted sources, is used with the function.
