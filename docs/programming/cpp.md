C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the [C](../programming/c.md) programming language, or "C with Classes". It was first introduced in 1985 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages.

C++ is particularly known for its performance and efficiency, as well as its support for [Object-Oriented Programming](../programming/oop.md), making it a popular choice for software development in various domains.

C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP), a paradigm that uses "objects" – data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions – to design applications and computer programs.

Known for its high performance and efficiency, C++ is widely used in software that requires high execution speed or tight resource management, such as game development, real-time systems, embedded systems, and high-performance computing.

C++ provides features for low-level memory manipulation, which is beneficial for programs that need direct interaction with the hardware or need to manage memory explicitly.

The language comes with a rich standard library known as the Standard Template Library (STL). STL provides a collection of classes and functions for data structures, algorithms, iterators, and other useful constructs.

C++ is used in developing a variety of applications, from operating systems, GUI-based applications, and 3D graphics engines to medical and engineering applications. Besides supporting OOP, C++ is also a multi-paradigm language, offering support for procedural, functional, and generic programming.

C++ can be used to develop applications that can be run on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac, Linux, and various embedded systems. C++ is compatible with C, allowing most C code to be compiled with a C++ compiler, which has made the transition from C to C++ relatively smooth for many developers.
