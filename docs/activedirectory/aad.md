Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service, which helps employees sign in and access resources in:

1. **External Resources**: Such as [Microsoft 365](../misc/m365.md), the [Azure](../cloud/azure.md) portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications.
2. **Internal Resources**: Like apps on your corporate network and intranet, along with any cloud apps developed by your own organization.

Azure AD provides [SSO](../security/sso.md) capabilities, allowing users to access multiple services and applications with a single set of credentials. [MFA](../security/mfa.md) enhances security by requiring multiple methods of verification to prove identity when accessing applications.

Azure AD allows the management of applications, both on-premises and in the cloud. You can also integrate your own developed applications with Azure AD for streamlined access control. It offers integration with Microsoft Intune for mobile device and application management, allowing control over how corporate data is accessed and used.

Azure AD provides automatic threat detection and remediation capabilities, helping to protect against identity-based security risks. These policies provide granular access control to apps and data based on specific conditions like user role, location, device health, and risk detection.

It integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft services like Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics 365, providing a unified identity across all Microsoft cloud services. Azure AD enables secure collaboration with external partners and contractors while maintaining control over your own corporate data.

It can also be used to manage and secure customer identities, enabling easy and secure access for customers to your applications. It includes a comprehensive set of directory services such as an [LDAP](../protocols/ldapp.md), Azure AD Domain Services, and the ability to integrate with [Active Directory](../activedirectory/activedirectory.md) on-premises.
