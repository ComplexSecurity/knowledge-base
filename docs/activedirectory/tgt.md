The Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) is a crucial component in the [Kerberos authentication](../activedirectory/kerb.md) protocol, used in many secure network environments. The TGT is central to the Kerberos method of authentication and plays a key role in the process of granting users access to network resources.

When a user first logs into the network, they provide their credentials (username and password) to the Kerberos [Authentication Service (AS)](../activedirectory/as.md). The AS verifies these credentials against the user database. Upon successful authentication, the AS issues a TGT to the user. This TGT is encrypted using a secret key known only to the AS and the [Ticket Granting Service (TGS)](../activedirectory/tgs.md).

The TGT serves as proof that the user has been authenticated. It contains the user's identity and a timestamp indicating its validity period. The user cannot decrypt the TGT themselves, as it is encrypted with the TGS's secret key. When the user requires access to a specific network service, they request a service ticket from the TGS. This request includes the TGT and the name of the service they want to access.

The TGS decrypts the TGT, validates it, and if the user is permitted to access the service, issues a service ticket for that service. This service ticket is then used by the user to access the desired network service.

The TGT is securely stored on the user's machine and is encrypted throughout its lifecycle to prevent tampering and unauthorized access. TGTs have a limited validity period, after which they expire and can no longer be used to request service tickets. This reduces the risk of long-term abuse if a TGT is compromised. Users can request a renewal of the TGT without re-entering their credentials, as long as the TGT hasn't expired.

In cybersecurity attacks, particularly those seeking to move laterally within a network, attackers often target TGTs. If an attacker can obtain a TGT (especially of a privileged account), they can potentially access multiple services within the network.
