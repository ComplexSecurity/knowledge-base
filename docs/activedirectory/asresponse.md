The Authentication Service Response (AS-REP) is a key component in the [Kerberos authentication](../activedirectory/kerb.md) protocol. It is the response sent by the Kerberos [Authentication Service (AS)](../activedirectory/as.md) to a client's request for authentication. 

When a user or service first attempts to log in or access a resource within a Kerberos-secured environment, the AS-REP is the message they receive from the AS after their credentials have been verified.

The AS-REP includes the [TGT](../activedirectory/tgt.md), which is encrypted with a key known only to the [Ticket Granting Service (TGS)](../activedirectory/tgs.md) and the [AS](../activedirectory/as.md). The TGT is used for requesting access to various services within the network without needing to re-authenticate.

Alongside the TGT, the AS-REP contains a session key, which is used for encrypting communication between the client and the TGS. This session key is encrypted with the user's password or a key derived from it, ensuring that only the legitimate user can use it. The AS-REP also includes information like timestamps and the validity period of the TGT, providing details about the session's lifespan.

The process begins with the user's client sending an [authentication request (AS-REQ)](../activedirectory/asreq.md) to the AS, usually including the user's principal name and a timestamp encrypted with the user's password. The AS verifies the user's credentials. If they are valid, the AS constructs the AS-REP, which includes the TGT and session key. Upon receiving the AS-REP, the client decrypts the session key using the user's password. The TGT remains encrypted (as the client cannot decrypt it) and is used for subsequent communications with the TGS.

The AS-REP is a fundamental part of the secure authentication process in Kerberos, ensuring that users are authenticated before they can access services within the Kerberos realm. The issuance of the TGT facilitates SSO, allowing the user to access multiple services without repeatedly entering credentials. By encrypting the session key and the TGT with the user's password and the TGS's key, respectively, the AS-REP ensures that these critical pieces of information are securely transmitted.
