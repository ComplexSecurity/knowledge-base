CouchDB, officially Apache CouchDB, is an open-source [[Non-relational Database|NoSQL]] database developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data as [[JavaScript Object Notation|JSON]]-like documents.

CouchDB is known for its ease of use, scalability, and a unique set of features that differentiate it from other NoSQL databases.

In CouchDB, data is stored in documents, each of which is identified by a unique ID and contains JSON data. This structure allows for storing complex data structures in a single document.

CouchDB provides a [[REST APIs|RESTful HTTP API]] for reading, creating, editing, and deleting documents. This makes it accessible from any environment that can send HTTP requests, making it easy to use with various programming languages and frameworks.

One of the standout features of CouchDB is its built-in replication and synchronization capability. This allows CouchDB databases to be replicated across multiple servers or devices, supporting offline access and data synchronization when connectivity is restored.

CouchDB is often used in applications that require easy and reliable replication across various devices and locations, like mobile apps, web applications, and in distributed or decentralized systems.
