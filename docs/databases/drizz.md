Drizzle is an open-source [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) that was forked from the popular [[MySQL (KB)|MySQL]] database. The project aimed to create a lightweight, cloud-friendly, and scalable database optimized for web applications and cloud infrastructure. Drizzle was designed to be simpler and more modular than MySQL, focusing on modern web development needs.

Drizzle was developed with a focus on being lightweight and modular. It aimed to remove unnecessary features and code from MySQL to make it leaner and more efficient, especially for web and cloud applications.

It was forked from MySQL, one of the most popular open-source relational databases, but with significant changes in its architecture and features to serve a different set of requirements.

Drizzle was optimized for cloud and net-centric applications. It was designed to work efficiently in distributed environments with a focus on high concurrency and low-latency operations.

One of the distinctive features of Drizzle was its microkernel architecture, allowing for a more pluggable and maintainable codebase. This architecture made it easier to add or remove specific functionalities based on the requirements.

Drizzle targeted web applications and aimed to improve query performance and scalability to handle large numbers of concurrent database connections, which are common in web environments.

Drizzle maintained [[ACID]] (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance for transactions, ensuring the reliability and integrity of data. Despite its focus on simplicity, Drizzle still supported key database features like stored procedures and triggers.

As an open-source project, Drizzle had active community support and contributions, although its development and popularity have been overshadowed by MySQL and other databases like [[PostgreSQL]] and [[MariaDB]].
