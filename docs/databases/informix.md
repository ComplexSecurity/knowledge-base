Informix is a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) originally developed by Informix Corporation before being acquired by IBM. It's known for its robustness and scalability, and it's particularly well-suited for online transaction processing (OLTP) as well as for integrated solutions that involve extensive data analysis (Online Analytical Processing, OLAP). 

Informix is recognized for its high performance, especially in environments that require high throughput and minimal response times, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.

The database is highly scalable, capable of handling large volumes of data and a significant number of concurrent users, which is essential for large enterprise applications.

Informix offers features such as data replication and clustering, which contribute to high availability and disaster recovery, ensuring data is always accessible and secure. It is designed to be easy to manage, with features that reduce the complexity and time required for database administration.

Informix includes support for time series data management, which is useful for applications that require efficient storage and querying of time-stamped data, such as [[IoT]] applications.

Informix can be deployed in the cloud, offering flexibility for businesses moving towards cloud-based solutions.
