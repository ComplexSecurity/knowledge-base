Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems designed to manage databases. A DBMS serves as an interface between the database and its users or other application programs, ensuring that the data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible.

A DBMS stores data in a structured format, typically in tables that consist of rows and columns. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database, often referred to as [[CRUD API|CRUD]] operations.

There are several types of DBMS, including:

- Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) - Data stored in relations (tables). Examples include [[MySQL (KB)]], [[Oracle Database]], [[Microsoft SQL Server]] and [[PostgreSQL]].
- Object-oriented Database Management Systems - Data stored in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming.
- NoSQL databases - designed for specific data models and have flexible schemas. Examples include [[MongoDB]], [[Apache Cassandra]] and [[Redis]].
- Hierarchical Database Systems - data is organized into a tree-like structure.
- Network Database Systems - data is represented as collections of records connected to one another through links.
