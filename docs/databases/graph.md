Graph-based [[Database Management Systems]] (DBMS) are specialized databases designed to store, manage, and query data in the form of graphs. Unlike traditional relational databases that store data in rows and columns, graph databases represent data as nodes (entities), edges (relationships), and properties. 

In graph databases, data is represented as a graph. Nodes typically represent entities (like people, businesses, products), while edges represent the relationships between these entities. Both nodes and edges can have properties (key-value pairs) that store additional information.

Graph databases are optimized for queries that involve traversing relationships, like finding the shortest path between two nodes or querying all nodes related to a specific node. They are highly efficient for complex queries that would require multiple joins in a relational database.

They are particularly useful in scenarios where relationships are as important as the data itself. Common use cases include social networks (mapping relationships between people), recommendation systems, fraud detection, network and IT operations, and more.
