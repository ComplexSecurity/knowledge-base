An Oracle database, in simple terms, is a type of database management system developed and marketed by Oracle Corporation. It's a collection of data treated as a unit, designed to store and manage large amounts of information in a structured way. Here's a basic breakdown of what an Oracle database involves:

1. **Database Management System (DBMS):** Oracle provides a DBMS, which is software that allows users to store, retrieve, modify, and manage data efficiently in a database.
2. **Relational Database:** The Oracle database is primarily a relational database, which means it organizes data into tables. These tables are connected to each other through relationships, making data retrieval and management more systematic and efficient.
3. **SQL and PL/SQL:** The database uses SQL (Structured Query Language) as its primary language for querying and manipulating data. Oracle also uses PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL), which is an extension of SQL designed specifically for the Oracle Database, adding procedural capabilities to the standard SQL.
4. **Scalability and Performance:** Oracle databases are known for their capability to handle large volumes of data and concurrent users, making them suitable for enterprise-level applications and systems.
5. **Advanced Features:** It includes advanced features like data partitioning, replication, and advanced security options, catering to complex business requirements and large-scale operations.
6. **Industry Use:** Oracle databases are widely used in business environments for various applications like online transaction processing, data warehousing, and enterprise resource planning.
