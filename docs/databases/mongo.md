MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support forÂ [[JavaScript Object Notation|JSON]]-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.

Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional [[Relational Database|relational databases]], MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. 

Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables.
