Wide-column [[Non-relational Database|NoSQL]] databases, also known as column-family stores, are a type of database that organizes data into columns, which are grouped together into column families. They are designed to efficiently store and access large volumes of data across distributed systems.

Unlike [[Relational Database|relational databases]] that organize data in rows, wide-column stores are optimized for queries over large datasets and allow for high scalability and performance.

Data is stored in tables, like in relational databases, but the focus is on columns rather than rows. Each row can have a different set of columns, and the column-oriented storage allows for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Data is grouped into column families, which are the basic data containers. Each column family contains rows with a unique key, and each row can have any number of columns associated with it.

Wide-column stores are schema-flexible, meaning that while the column families are defined, the columns within them can vary from row to row. This flexibility allows for efficient storage of semi-structured or unstructured data.

These databases are designed to scale out horizontally, distributing data across many nodes. They can handle large volumes of data and high read/write throughput, making them suitable for big data applications.

They are often used in big data analytics, time-series data, content management systems, and any application that requires large-scale data storage and high-speed access.
