PostgreSQL is an open-source, highly stable [[Databases (KB)|database]] system that provides support to different functions of [[Structured Query Language|SQL]], like foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, and different user-defined types and functions. It further augments the SQL language proffering up several features that meticulously scale and reserve data workloads.

It’s primarily used to store data for many mobile, web, geospatial, and analytics applications.

PostgreSQL supports a wide range of programming languages, including [[Python]], [[Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby]], and Tcl making it versatile for various app development needs. 

It also offers an extensive selection of data types, including primitives (integer, numeric, string, boolean), structured types (date/time, array, range/multirange, UUID), document types ([[JavaScript Object Notation|JSON]], [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]]), geometry types (point, line, circle, polygon)
