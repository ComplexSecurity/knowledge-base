Document-based [[Non-relational Database|NoSQL]] databases are a type of non-relational database that store data in the form of documents. These databases are designed to handle a wide variety of data types and structures, and they are particularly well-suited for managing semi-structured and unstructured data.

In these databases, data is stored in documents, which are typically represented in formats like JSON ([[JavaScript Object Notation]]), BSON ([[Binary JSON]]), or [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]]. Each document can contain a complex hierarchy of nested elements and can represent an entire entity with various attributes and their values.

Document-based databases are often schema-less or schema-flexible, meaning they do not require a predefined schema for the data. Each document can have its own unique structure, and the structure can evolve over time without the need to alter a centralized database schema.

These databases provide robust querying capabilities. They allow indexing of documents for efficient data retrieval and can support complex queries, including those that operate within the nested structures of the documents.

Common use cases include content management systems, e-commerce platforms, real-time analytics, and any application dealing with diverse data sets that do not fit neatly into tabular structures like those used in relational databases.

These databases often integrate well with modern web applications, offering [[REST APIs|RESTful APIs]], and are compatible with various programming languages and frameworks.
