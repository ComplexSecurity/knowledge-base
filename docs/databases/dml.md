Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL ([[Structured Query Language]]) used for adding (inserting), deleting, and modifying (updating) data in a database. DML is one of the key elements of SQL and is essential for managing and manipulating the data stored in relational databases.

DML primarily includes three types of operations:

- **Insert**: Adding new rows of data to a table.
- **Update**: Modifying existing data within a table.
- **Delete**: Removing data from a table.

The `INSERT` statement is used to add new records to a database table. It allows specifying both the columns and the values to insert. The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing records in a table. It typically involves specifying a condition to identify which rows to update and what new values should be assigned to specific columns.

The `DELETE` statement removes existing records from a table, usually based on a condition that specifies which rows should be deleted. DML operations often involve transactional control commands like `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`. These commands manage transaction processing, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

DML statements are considered non-destructive in terms of database schema. They modify the data within the tables without altering the table structure itself. DML statements are fundamental to [[CRUD API|CRUD]] (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in database systems, forming the backbone of most database interactions in applications.

When performing DML operations, especially in application development, itâ€™s important to guard against SQL injection attacks. This is often achieved through the use of prepared statements or ORM ([[Object-Relational Mapping]]) frameworks.

DML commands are used in various [[Database Management Systems]] (DBMS), like [[MySQL (KB)|MySQL]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]], [[PostgreSQL]], and others, making them a core skill for database professionals and developers.
