SAP MaxDB is a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) developed and provided by SAP SE. It's designed for large-scale database environments and is particularly optimized for use with [[SAP applications]], but it can also be used independently.

MaxDB is known for its high performance and scalability, making it suitable for managing large databases and handling high transaction volumes, which are typical in enterprise environments.

It is capable of handling large amounts of data, with support for databases in the terabyte range. This makes it a good fit for data-intensive applications. While MaxDB can be used as a standalone database system, it is particularly optimized for integration with other SAP applications, such as [[Enterprise Resource Planning Applications|SAP ERP]] systems. This integration offers enhanced performance and data management capabilities for SAP environments.

MaxDB supports SQL ([[Structured Query Language]]) for database queries, making it accessible to those familiar with SQL. While optimized for SAP applications, MaxDB can also be integrated into environments where multiple types of database systems are used.
