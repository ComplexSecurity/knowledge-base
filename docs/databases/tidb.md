TiDB is an open-source, distributed [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] database that is designed to support both online transactional processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP) operations. TiDB aims to provide a scalable, [[MySQL (KB)|MySQL]]-compatible database solution that can handle hybrid workloads.

One of the core features of TiDB is its ability to scale horizontally with ease. This means that you can add more nodes to the system to increase capacity and throughput without significant changes to the application or the database.

TiDB is designed to be compatible with MySQL, which means that applications built for MySQL can usually run on TiDB without modification. This eases migration from MySQL and integration with existing MySQL-based applications.

TiDB supports both OLTP and OLAP workloads, making it a hybrid transactional and analytical processing database. This capability allows businesses to perform real-time analytics on transactional data.

The architecture of TiDB includes TiDB server (stateless SQL layer), TiKV (distributed transactional key-value storage), and PD (Placement Driver) servers that manage metadata and cluster coordination.

TiDB provides high availability and strong consistency. It replicates data across multiple nodes, ensuring that the failure of a single node does not lead to data loss. TiDB supports real-time analytics by allowing complex SQL queries to be run directly on the transactional data without requiring ETL processes or a separate analytical database.

TiDB is designed to run well in cloud environments. It supports deployment in public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid cloud environments. TiDB supports full ACID-compliant transactions, which is critical for applications that require strong data consistency and integrity.

The database allows for the flexible addition or reduction of nodes, enabling it to adjust resource allocation dynamically based on workload demands. As an open-source project, TiDB has a growing community and ecosystem, with contributions from developers and adoption by various companies.
