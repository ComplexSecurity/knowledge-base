MySQL is a freely available open source [[Relational Database Management System]] (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL). It stores that information in separate “tables” and connects it with “keys”, which is why it’s relational.

When your WordPress site needs to access that information, it sends a request to the MySQL database server using SQL (this is the [[client]]-[[server]] model).

Users can define, manipulate, control, and query data using [[Structured Query Language]], more commonly known as [SQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-sql).
