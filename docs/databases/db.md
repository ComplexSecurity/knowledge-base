A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by aÂ [database management system (DBMS)](https://www.oracle.com/uk/database/what-is-database/#WhatIsDBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modelled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use [[Structured Query Language|structured query language]] (SQL) for writing and querying data.
