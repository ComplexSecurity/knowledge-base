Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. A Relational database is based on a Relational Model architecture. The data is organized in tables (relations), and the tables are related to each other. Each table has rows and columns (attributes). MS SQL Server is a software product used to administer the database and retrieve information. 

As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applicationsâ€”which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet).
