Firebird is an open-source [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) that offers many ANSI SQL standard features. It's a descendant of Borland's InterBase SQL Server and was initially released as open source in 2000.

Firebird can run on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and several Unix flavors, offering flexibility in deployment. Being open-source, Firebird is free for use and modification, which makes it an attractive option for small to medium-sized businesses or anyone needing a cost-effective database solution.

It supports standard [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] features, stored procedures, triggers, and supports ACID-compliant transactions. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications.

It provides robust security features, including support for SSL encryption and robust user authentication.
