Altibase is a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) that provides high-performance data processing and real-time data analysis. It is known for being an in-memory database, meaning it stores data primarily in main memory (RAM) for faster data access, but it also supports disk-resident databases. 

Altibase is used in various sectors, including finance, telecommunications, manufacturing, and services.

Altibase combines the speed of an in-memory database with the storage capacity of an on-disk database, offering the benefits of both in a single unified system. Due to its in-memory architecture, Altibase provides extremely fast data processing, making it suitable for applications that require real-time or near-real-time data processing.

Altibase adheres to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable transaction processing and data integrity. Altibase supports horizontal and vertical scalability, allowing it to handle increasing loads by adding more servers (horizontal) or adding resources like CPUs or memory to existing servers (vertical).

It offers high availability features, including replication and failover capabilities, to ensure continuous operation and data availability. Altibase supports [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] standards, making it accessible to developers familiar with SQL and traditional relational databases.

It is compatible with various platforms and provides integration capabilities with other databases and external systems.

Altibase is used in various applications that require fast data access and processing, such as telecommunications billing systems, finance (for trading and risk management), manufacturing (for supply chain management), and [[IoT]] data processing.

Altibase was made open source in 2019, allowing wider access to its technology. It also offers a commercial version with enterprise-grade features and support.
