FrontBase is a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) that was designed for high-demand, scalable, and fault-tolerant environments. It is known for its robustness and support for the [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] standards. 

FrontBase was developed by FrontBase, Inc. and is used in various applications, ranging from web applications to enterprise-level solutions.

FrontBase is designed to be in compliance with SQL-92 and SQL-99 standards, offering broad compatibility with SQL-based applications and tools. The database ensures [[ACID]] (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, which is crucial for transactional integrity and reliability.

FrontBase is built to handle large-scale data requirements and high-concurrency environments, making it suitable for enterprise applications that demand high performance.

It supports multiple platforms, including various versions of UNIX, Linux, Windows, and macOS. This cross-platform capability allows for flexibility in deployment and integration with various systems.

The database offers comprehensive Unicode support, which is essential for applications that require multi-language support. FrontBase includes strong security features, like SSL support for encrypted connections and robust access control mechanisms to protect data.

It has been used in both web-based applications, including dynamic websites, and more traditional enterprise environments. FrontBase provides graphical tools for database management, making it easier to administer, even for those who are not command-line experts.

The RDBMS supports stored procedures and triggers, allowing for advanced data manipulation and automated database operations. Designed for fault-tolerant environments, FrontBase offers features that ensure high availability of data and services, which is a key requirement for mission-critical systems.
