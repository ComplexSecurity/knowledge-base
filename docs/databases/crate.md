CrateDB is an open-source, distributed [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] database designed for real-time analytics of large-scale data. It combines the scalability and performance of [[Non-relational Database|NoSQL]] systems with the ease of use and familiarity of SQL. CrateDB is particularly known for its ability to handle massive amounts of machine data in real-time.

CrateDB is built to be a distributed database. It automatically replicates and partitions data across multiple nodes in a cluster, enhancing performance, scalability, and resilience.

While CrateDB supports standard SQL for querying data, it also offers NoSQL-like features, such as schema-less document storage, making it a versatile choice for various types of data.

One of the key strengths of CrateDB is its capability to perform real-time analytics on large datasets, making it suitable for applications like [[IoT]], machine data analysis, and log data management.

CrateDB can scale horizontally, meaning you can add more nodes to the cluster to increase capacity and improve performance. This makes it well-suited for handling large-scale data workloads.

The distributed nature of CrateDB ensures high availability. Data is replicated across different nodes, ensuring that the system can withstand node failures without data loss. CrateDB includes full-text search capabilities, allowing for efficient searching through large volumes of text-based data.

It offers support for geospatial data and queries, which is valuable for location-based services and applications. CrateDB supports a variety of data types, including object, array, geospatial, full-text, and traditional scalar types, accommodating a wide range of data modeling requirements.

CrateDB is designed to be easy to set up and operate. It can run on commodity hardware or be deployed in cloud environments. Typical use cases for CrateDB include industrial sensor data analysis, system and application logs, IoT applications, and any context where real-time insights into large volumes of data are essential.
