MariaDB is a popular open-source [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) that is a fork of [[MySQL (KB)]]. It was created by the original developers of MySQL after concerns over Oracle's acquisition of MySQL in 2010. 

MariaDB is designed to be highly compatible with MySQL, meaning that it follows the same schemas and structure and is essentially a drop-in replacement for MySQL. However, it includes new features, performance enhancements, and security improvements that are not present in MySQL.

MariaDB is largely compatible with MySQL, both in terms of API and command line. This means that for most applications, MariaDB can be used as a direct replacement for MySQL with minimal changes.

MariaDB includes several new features and extensions that are not available in MySQL, including new storage engines, optimizations for speed and reliability, and improved query execution. MariaDB supports a wide variety of storage engines, including some that are not available in MySQL, allowing for more flexibility in how data is stored and accessed.
