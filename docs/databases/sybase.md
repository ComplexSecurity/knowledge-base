Sybase, originally known as Sybase Inc., was a software company that specialized in [[database management systems]] (DBMS) and mobile software. Established in 1984, Sybase played a significant role in the development and evolution of relational databases.

Sybase was one of the first companies to develop and commercialize a relational database with a client-server architecture, which was a significant innovation in the 1980s.

Sybase SQL Server was their flagship product, a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS), which became popular for its fast performance and scalability. It was particularly favored in the financial sector for trading systems and other high-volume applications.

Sybase SQL Server was among the first RDBMS to implement a [[Client-Server Architecture|client-server architecture]]. This approach separated the database processing work (server) from the user interface application (client), greatly enhancing efficiency and scalability.

Sybase developed [[Transact-SQL]], an extension of SQL, to include procedural programming and local variables. This language became widely adopted and was also used by [[Microsoft SQL Server]].
