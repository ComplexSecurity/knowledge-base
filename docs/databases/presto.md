Presto is an open-source distributed [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] query engine designed for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes, ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. Originally developed by Facebook to handle massive amounts of data, Presto is now part of the Linux Foundation's Presto Foundation.

Presto is designed for high-speed, read-only data queries. It is particularly efficient in performing large-scale data analytics. Presto operates in a distributed system. It processes queries in parallel across multiple nodes, making it highly scalable and capable of providing rapid query responses.

One of Presto's key features is its ability to query data from multiple sources, including traditional [[Relational Database|relational databases]] and [[Non-relational Database|NoSQL]] databases. It can query data stored in [[Hadoop]] Distributed File System (HDFS), Amazon S3, [[MySQL]], [[Apache Cassandra|Cassandra]], Kafka, and many others, without requiring data movement or transformation.

Presto allows users to query data using standard ANSI SQL, which is familiar to many users and makes it accessible to a wide range of applications and tools. While Presto does not store any data itself (it's not a database), it processes data in-memory, which contributes to its fast query performance.

It is optimized for interactive queries, enabling users to run analytical queries on large datasets and receive responses in real-time or near-real-time. Prestoâ€™s distributed nature allows it to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. This makes it suitable for large-scale data processing tasks.

Presto has a strong and active community. It's used by numerous large companies and has a growing ecosystem of tools and integrations. Presto is widely used in data science, business intelligence, and data analytics to quickly run queries on large datasets. It's popular in environments where data is spread across multiple systems.
