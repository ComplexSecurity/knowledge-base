A Relational [[Database Management Systems]] (RDBMS) is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

In an RDBMS, data is organized into tables (also known as relations), which consist of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a data field. Rows in different tables can be related based on common data fields.

RDBMSs use [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] for querying and maintaining the database. SQL is a powerful and standardized language used to perform various operations like data insertion, querying, update, and deletion.

RDBMSs provide data integrity and a way to maintain the accuracy and consistency of data. This is achieved through constraints, rules, and relationships defined in the database schema.

Popular examples include [[MySQL (KB)]], [[Oracle Database]], [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]], [[PostgreSQL]], and [[SQLite]].
