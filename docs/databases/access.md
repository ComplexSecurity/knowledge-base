Microsoft Access is a [[Database Management Systems|database management system]] (DBMS) from Microsoft that combines the relational Microsoft Jet Database Engine with a graphical user interface and software-development tools. 

It is part of the Microsoft Office suite of applications, included in the Professional and higher editions.

Access is known for its user-friendly interface that allows users to create and manage databases without requiring extensive knowledge of database programming. It provides a range of templates to get started quickly.

Users can create databases from scratch or by using pre-built templates. Access provides tools for defining, modifying, and managing data tables, queries, forms, and reports. Although Access is more accessible to non-programmers, it is based on a [[relational database]] model. It allows users to establish relationships between different data tables.
