  
Flask is a micro web framework for [Python](../programming/python.md), designed to make it easy to build web applications quickly and with minimal boilerplate code. It is considered "micro" because it provides the basic tools and components needed for web development, allowing developers to choose and integrate additional libraries and modules as needed, rather than including everything in the framework itself.

Flask is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use, making it a popular choice among Python developers for building web applications and [APIs](../terms/apis.md).

Flask provides just essentials for building web apps, such as routing, request handling, and response generation. Flask is also built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit, which handles [HTTP](../web/http.md) request/response handling and integrates with the [Jinja2](../web/jinja2.md) template engine.

Flask also allows you to define [URL](../web/url.md) routes using decorators, making it easy to map URLs to specific functions or views. It also supports various [HTTP Verbs](../web/verbs.md) including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and more, making it suitable for [REST APIs](../web/restapis.md).
