The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java programming language framework that manages relational data in applications using [[Java]] Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. Part of the Java EE and Java SE specifications, JPA provides an [[Object-Relational Mapping]] (ORM) approach to handle the relational data in a way that's more aligned with object-oriented programming practices.

JPA is used for mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa. This allows developers to work with data in a more object-oriented way, rather than using complex [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] queries. 

JPA is a standard API, which means it's not tied to any specific implementation. This allows developers to switch between different JPA providers, like Hibernate, EclipseLink, or Apache OpenJPA, without changing the application code.

JPA uses annotations in the Java code or [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] configuration files to define the relationship between Java classes and database tables, and how fields in a class correspond to columns in a table. The `EntityManager` interface is a key part of JPA, used for creating, reading, and removing data. It acts as a factory for query objects and manages the lifecycle of entities.

[[JPQL]] is a query language, similar to SQL, but operates on Java objects rather than tables. It allows for database operations using object-oriented principles. JPA manages a set of entity instances in a persistence context, providing a cache of database data. This can improve application performance by reducing the number of database accesses.

JPA supports transaction management to ensure data integrity and consistency. JPA simplifies data persistence in Java applications, especially those with complex database interactions. It abstracts the complexity of direct JDBC code, providing a more object-oriented programming model for database interaction.

JPA is often used in conjunction with other Java EE technologies like Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) and [[Java Transaction API (JTA)]]. Because JPA is a standard API, applications written with JPA can be easily ported to different databases with minimal changes.
