Bulma is a free class-based framework for [CSS](../programming/css.md). It allows developers to implement CSS on web pages more efficiently than plain CSS. First released in 2016, Bulma has gained traction among front-end developers, enough to compete with other well-known CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](../frameworks/bootstrap.md).

Bulma is built onÂ [Flexbox](../web/fbox.md), a CSS layout model that automatically adjusts the width of a page element based on the width of its container. Flexbox requires developers to write both [HTML](../web/html.md) and CSS to create elements that adhere to this model. With Bulma, Flexbox behavior and most other things can be handled with HTML classes.
