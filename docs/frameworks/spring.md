Spring Boot is an open-source [Java](../programming/java.md)-based framework that simplifies the development of production-ready and stand-alone Spring-based applications. It provides a convention-over-configuration approach, reducing the need for extensive boilerplate code and configuration. Spring Boot is part of the larger [Spring Framework](../frameworks/springframe.md) ecosystem and is designed to streamline the process of building, deploying, and running Spring applications.

Spring Boot follows the convention-over-configuration principle, minimizing the need for developers to specify a large amount of configuration. It comes with sensible defaults and auto-configuration options, allowing developers to focus on application logic.

Spring Boot enables the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal effort. Applications can be packaged as executable [JARs (Java Archive)](../misc/jar.md) or [WARs (Web Application Archive)](../misc/war.md) for deployment.

Spring Boot includes support for embedded web servers such as [Tomcat](../misc/tomcat.md), [Jetty](../misc/jetty.md), and [[Undertow]]. This eliminates the need for external web server deployment, simplifying the deployment process. Spring Boot includes a comprehensive set of default configurations for various components, including databases, messaging queues, and more. Auto-configuration automatically adapts to the libraries on the classpath, reducing manual configuration.

Starters are pre-configured templates that provide a convenient way to add dependencies to your project. They simplify the process of including common libraries and configurations for specific tasks such as web development, data access, and messaging.

Spring Boot is well-suited for building microservices-based architectures. It facilitates the development of individual microservices that can work together to form a larger application. Actuator is a set of production-ready features provided by Spring Boot for monitoring and managing applications. It includes endpoints for health checks, application metrics, environment properties, and more.

DevTools provide features such as automatic application restarts, live reloading of changed resources, and enhanced development experience to boost developer productivity. The CLI allows developers to create, run, and test Spring Boot applications from the command line. It provides a concise syntax for creating applications quickly.

While Spring Boot provides default configurations, it remains highly extensible. Developers can override defaults and customize configurations based on specific application requirements.
