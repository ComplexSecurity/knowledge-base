OSGi (Open Service Gateway Initiative) is a [Java](../programming/java.md) framework for developing and deploying modular software programs and libraries. It provides specifications that define a system for modular architecture in Java, enabling components, known as bundles in OSGi terminology, to be dynamically installed, activated, updated, or removed at runtime.

OSGi promotes strong modularity and encapsulation, which is a step beyond traditional Java classpath and [JAR](../misc/jar.md) file mechanisms. Each OSGi bundle is a self-contained module that provides explicit details about its dependencies and services.

Bundles are the primary components in OSGi; they are essentially JAR files with additional metadata. The metadata, defined in the `MANIFEST.MF` file, specifies information about the bundle, such as version, dependencies, and packages that it exports or imports.

One of the key features of OSGi is the ability to manage components dynamically at runtime. Bundles can be installed, started, stopped, updated, or uninstalled on-the-fly without needing to restart the entire application.

OSGi supports a form of [Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)](../misc/soa.md). Bundles can register services, which other bundles can discover and use, promoting loose coupling between different components. OSGi has a robust versioning and dependency resolution mechanism, allowing multiple versions of the same library to coexist and resolving dependencies based on specified version ranges.

OSGi is used in various applications, from embedded devices and mobile applications to large-scale enterprise systems. Its dynamic module system makes it suitable for long-running applications where hot-deployment and updates are required.

The Eclipse IDE is one of the most notable examples of an application built on OSGi, demonstrating the framework's capabilities in a complex, modular, and extensible desktop application.

While OSGi provides many benefits in terms of modularity and flexibility, it also has a reputation for complexity, particularly in understanding the class loading model and debugging issues related to dynamic module interactions. OSGi can be used alongside other Java technologies and frameworks, although integration may require additional consideration due to its unique architectural model.

OSGi is developed and maintained by the OSGi Alliance, a consortium of technology companies and is standardized, ensuring consistent and reliable behavior across different implementations.
