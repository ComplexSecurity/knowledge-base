[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free and open-source web development framework. It’s designed to ease the web development process of responsive, mobile-first websites by providing a collection of syntax for template designs.

In other words, Bootstrap helps web developers build websites faster as they don’t need to worry about basic commands and functions. It consists of [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript|JS]]-based scripts for various web design-related functions and components.

Bootstrap’s primary objective is to create responsive, mobile-first websites. It ensures all interface elements of a website work optimally on all screen sizes.

Bootstrap is available in two variants ‒ **precompiled** and **based on a source code version**. Experienced developers prefer the latter since it lets them customize the styles to suit their projects.

For example, the “source code” version of Bootstrap lets you access the [[SASS]] port. This means it creates a custom stylesheet that imports Bootstrap, allowing you to modify and extend the tool as needed.

Some of the most popular package managers include [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), and [Bower](https://bower.io/). **Npm** manages server-side dependencies, while **Composer** focuses on the front-end. If you work on PHP-based projects, consider using **Bower** instead.

Due to its popularity, more and more Bootstrap communities emerge. These are great places for web developers and web designers to share knowledge and discuss the latest versions of Bootstrap patches.
