The .NET Framework is a software development framework created by Microsoft that provides a controlled programming environment where software can be developed, installed, and executed on Windows-based operating systems. It was first released in 2002 and has become a foundational technology for a wide range of Microsoft software and services.

At the core of the .NET Framework is the CLR, which provides a runtime environment for executing .NET applications. It handles memory management, security, exception handling, and more.

The .NET Framework includes a vast class library known as the Framework Class Library (FCL), offering an extensive range of reusable types, components, and services, which significantly simplifies the development process.

The framework supports multiple programming languages, including [C#](../programming/csharp.md), [VB.NET](../programming/vbnet.md), and [F#](../programming/fsharp.md). This interoperability allows for the integration of code written in different languages in the same project.

The BCL is part of the FCL and includes classes that provide basic functionalities like file reading/writing, graphic rendering, database interaction, and [XML](../programming/xml.md) document manipulation.

For web development, the .NET Framework includes [ASP.NET](../frameworks/aspnet.md), a powerful platform for building dynamic websites, web applications, and web services.

It provides tools and libraries for building desktop applications, notably Windows Forms for standard GUI applications and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for more complex, rich UI applications.

For data access, ADO.NET offers tools for working with databases and executing data operations. The .NET Framework compiles the source code into an intermediate language (IL) which is then compiled to native code by the CLR at runtime, a process known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
