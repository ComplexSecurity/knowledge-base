Symfony is a popular open-source [PHP](../programming/php.md) web application framework used to develop web applications and websites. It follows the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](../misc/mvc.md) architectural pattern and provides a set of tools and components that streamline the development process, making it more efficient and maintainable.

Symfony is highly modular, allowing developers to use only the components they need for a particular project. This modularity enhances code reuse and promotes a more flexible development process.

Symfony provides a wide range of standalone and reusable components (such as routing, form handling, authentication, and more) that developers can use in their projects, even if they're not building a full-fledged Symfony application.

Symfony follows the MVC architectural pattern, separating the application into three main components: Model (business logic and data handling), View (presentation and user interface), and Controller (handling user input and managing flow).

Symfony integrates with [Doctrine](../programming/doctrine.md), an [Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)](../programming/orp.md) system that facilitates database interactions by allowing developers to work with databases using object-oriented concepts. Symfony uses the [Twig](../web/twig.md) templating engine by default, providing a clean and efficient way to separate the presentation layer from the application logic.

Symfony promotes the use of dependency injection, a design pattern that helps manage object dependencies and makes code more modular and testable. Symfony comes with various built-in tools for tasks such as testing, debugging, and profiling. The Symfony Console component allows developers to create command-line tools effortlessly.

Symfony has a large and active community, which means that developers can find extensive documentation, tutorials, and community support. Additionally, there is an ecosystem of third-party bundles and extensions that can be easily integrated into Symfony applications.
