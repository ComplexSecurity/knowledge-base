Express.js is the most popular backend framework for [[NodeJS|Node.js]], and it is an extensive part of the [[JavaScript]] ecosystem.

It gives you the routing system and simplified features to extend the framework by developing more powerful components and parts depending on your application use cases. The framework provides a set of tools for web applications, HTTP requests and responses, routing, and middleware for building and deploying large-scale, enterprise-ready applications.

It also provides a command-line interface tool (CLI) called **Node Package Manager** (NPM), where developers can source for developed packages. It also forces developers to follow the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.

The DRY principle is aimed at reducing the repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions, or using data normalizations to avoid redundancy.

It is designed to build single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications, it has also become the standard for developing backend applications with Node.js, and it is the backend part of something known as the MEVN stack.

The MEVN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic websites and web applications that has the following components:

- [[MongoDB]]
- Express
- [[Vue.js]]
- [[NodeJS]]
