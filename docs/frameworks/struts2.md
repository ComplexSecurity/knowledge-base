Apache Struts 2 is an open-source web application framework for developing [[Java]] web applications. It is part of the [[Apache Struts|Apache Struts]] project and is designed to simplify the development of web applications by providing an MVC ([[Model-View-Controller (MVC)|Model-View-Controller]]) architecture and various features for handling web requests and responses.

MVC Architecture:

- **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic.
- **View:** Displays the user interface and receives user input.
- **Controller:** Manages the flow of the application, handling requests, and interacting with the model and view.

Struts 2 provides tag libraries for creating UI components, making it easier to develop dynamic and interactive web pages. Interceptors in Struts 2 allow developers to apply cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, validation, and security, to the application's actions. It includes a powerful validation framework for declarative validation of user input.

Struts 2 integrates with various technologies and libraries, including [[JSP|JavaServer Pages (JSP)]], [[Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs)|JavaBeans]], and custom tag libraries. Struts 2 uses [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] or annotation-based configuration, providing flexibility in defining actions, results, and interceptors. 

Struts 2 supports the development of [[REST APIs|RESTful]] web services by providing annotations and conventions for creating RESTful actions. Developers can extend Struts 2 functionality through plug-ins, allowing for customization and integration with other frameworks.

Struts 2 includes features to address security concerns, such as protection against common web application vulnerabilities like [[Cross-Site Scripting]] (XSS) and [[Cross-Site Request Forgery]] (CSRF).

While Apache Struts 2 offers powerful features for web application development, it's important for developers to follow best practices, especially regarding security, to prevent vulnerabilities such as [[OGNL injection]], which has been a concern in the past. Regular updates and adherence to secure coding practices are recommended to ensure the robustness of applications built with Apache Struts 2.
