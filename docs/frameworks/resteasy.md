RESTEasy is a [[Java]] framework that provides support for developing [[REST APIs|RESTful]] Web Services. It is an implementation of the [[JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services)|JAX-RS]] specification, which is the Java API for RESTful Web Services. RESTEasy is primarily used for creating and deploying RESTful services in Java, and it is known for its simplicity and ease of use.

RESTEasy is an implementation of the JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) specification. JAX-RS is a set of interfaces and annotations offered by Java for creating RESTful web services. The framework facilitates the development of services that use [[HTTP Protocol|HTTP]] protocols to communicate and follow the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural principles.

RESTEasy can be easily integrated with various [[Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)|Java EE (Enterprise Edition)]] and [[Java SE (Standard Edition)]] applications. It's particularly well-suited for use with the Java EE ecosystem. Besides the standard JAX-RS features, RESTEasy includes additional features like [[JSON-P]] (JSON Processing), [[Asynchronous HTTP]], [[Server-sent Events (SSE)]], and more.

It supports pluggable providers to extend its capabilities. Providers can be used for things like MessageBodyReaders/Writers, ExceptionMappers, and ContextResolvers. RESTEasy includes a client API for accessing RESTful resources. The client API allows for easy interaction with RESTful web services.

Being a JAX-RS implementation, RESTEasy applications are portable across any server container that supports JAX-RS. The framework supports various data formats including [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]], [[JavaScript Object Notation|JSON]], [[YAML]], and more for data exchange.

It can be integrated with popular frameworks like [[Spring Framework|Spring]] and can be run in servlet containers like [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]] or application servers like [[WildFly]].
