Vue.js (or simply Vue) is a lightweight, [JavaScript](../programming/js.md) framework for building reactive web user interfaces. Vue extends standard [HTML](../web/html.md) and [CSS](../programming/css.md) to create a suite of powerful tools for building the front end of interactive web applications.

Operating within the model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) framework, the main library of Vue focuses on the viewmodel layer, providing reactive synchronization between the model and view layers via two-way data binding. This simplifies the creation of modern web apps based on the single-page application (SPA) model.

Data binding allows Vue to dynamically update HTML elements that are “bound” to underlying Vue objects. This enables developers to create web applications that can run in a user’s browser and provide an interactive experience that doesn’t require refreshing the page.

With the ability to update HTML and CSS displayed in the browser in response to events in the underlying JavaScript, developers can use Vue to create everything from live chats to animated video games within a web browser.
