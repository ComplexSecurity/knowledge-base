AngularJS framework is used for creating dynamic web apps with a structural architecture. This framework enables using [HTML](../web/html.md) as the template language and facilitates the extension of HTML’s syntax to express application components clearly and concisely. 

Features such as Data binding and dependency injection reduce the code required. The whole process occurs solely within the browser, rendering it a suitable complement to any server technology.

With this JavaScript MVC framework, you can effortlessly craft dynamic web applications packed with features and experience the multitude of benefits it offers, empowering developers to create web applications that are both user-friendly and engaging and captivating.

Also, at the place where different JavaScript frameworks concentrate on extending the JavaScript capabilities itself, the true Angular JS meaning is to provide techniques for improving HTML. 

Therefore, the AngularJS framework helps to expand and enhance the HTML capabilities over being a plain and easy markup language. AngularJS also enables software developers to prevent the challenging workarounds that are usually essential when attempting to develop responsive applications with the help of HTML front-ends.
