Apache Camel is an open-source integration framework that facilitates the integration of various systems, applications, and data across an enterprise. It provides a set of pre-built components and a rule-based routing engine to define and execute integration patterns. Apache Camel simplifies the development of complex integration solutions by offering a declarative and domain-specific language for expressing integration routes.

Apache Camel supports a wide range of [[Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP)]], which are common solutions to recurring integration challenges. These patterns include messaging, transformation, routing, and mediation. Camel is designed with a modular and extensible architecture. It offers a large number of components that connect to different systems and protocols. Examples include [[HTTP Protocol|HTTP]], [[JMS]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[JDBC]], and many more. These components abstract the complexities of interacting with various technologies.

Camel uses a rule-based routing engine to define how messages should be routed between different systems. The routing rules are expressed in a domain-specific language that is easy to understand and maintain. Camel provides support for data transformation using various data formats, including [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]], [[JavaScript Object Notation|JSON]], and CSV. It allows developers to transform data as it moves through the integration process.

Camel enables content-based routing, where messages are routed based on their content or attributes. This allows for flexible and dynamic routing decisions. The framework includes robust error-handling mechanisms, allowing developers to define error-handling strategies and specify how to handle exceptions during integration processes.

Camel is highly extensible, allowing developers to create custom components, processors, and transformers. This extensibility ensures that the framework can be adapted to specific integration requirements. Camel supports a variety of communication protocols, making it suitable for integrating systems with diverse communication requirements. This includes support for messaging protocols, web services, and [[REST APIs|RESTful]] APIs.

Camel integrates seamlessly with [[Apache ActiveMQ]], a popular open-source message broker. This allows for reliable messaging and communication between different components. Camel offers tooling and integrations with popular IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) such as Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. This makes it easier for developers to design, test, and debug integration routes.

Camel includes features such as transaction management, security, and monitoring, making it suitable for building enterprise-grade integration solutions.
