Android is a widely-used operating system for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Developed by Android Inc., which Google acquired in 2005, Android is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software. It was designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices and has become one of the most popular operating systems globally. 

Android is an open-source platform, allowing manufacturers and developers to modify and customize the OS for various hardware platforms.

Android versions are typically named in alphabetical order and have historically been named after sweets or desserts, like Android 8.0 Oreo, Android 9.0 Pie, etc., though Google announced a shift to numerical versioning starting with Android 10.

Android devices typically come with pre-installed Google services, including the Google Play Store, which is the primary source for Android apps, games, movies, music, and books. Android's user interface is based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects.

Android applications (apps) are primarily written in the [[Java]] language using the [[Android Software Development Kit (SDK)]]. Kotlin and C++ are also used. The Android architecture consists of several layers, including the Linux kernel (hardware abstraction), libraries, Android runtime (ART), and the application framework.

Due to the wide variety of Android devices with different screen sizes, hardware specifications, and operating system versions, there's a notable issue of fragmentation in the Android ecosystem. 

Android includes various built-in security features such as app sandboxing, Google Play Protect for app scanning, and regular security updates. However, the openness of the platform can lead to security challenges.
