AWS WAF, or Amazon Web Services [[Web Application Firewall (WAF)|Web Application Firewall]], is a cloud-based security service provided by Amazon Web Services. It is designed to protect web applications from common web exploits and attacks that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. 

AWS WAF allows for the creation of custom rules that control web traffic. These rules can be designed to block, allow or monitor web requests based on specific conditions such as [[IP Address|IP addresses]], [[HTTP Headers]], HTTP body, URI strings, [[SQL injection]] and [[Cross-Site Scripting]].

It offers protection against common attack vectors like SQLi and XSS.
