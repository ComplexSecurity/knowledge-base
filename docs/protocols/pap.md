Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is a simple authentication protocol used in networking environments, particularly in [Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)](../networking/ppp.md) connections. PAP is used to validate users trying to access a network and is known for its simplicity and basic level of security. 

PAP authenticates a user by sending a username and password to the server in plain text, without any encryption. The server then verifies the credentials against its database. The most significant drawback of PAP is that it sends the username and password over the network in clear text, making it susceptible to interception and eavesdropping.

Typically, PAP only authenticates the client to the server. It does not provide a means for the client to authenticate the server, which can be a security risk. PAP is commonly used in PPP connections, such as those used in some dial-up internet services and older network systems.

The main advantage of PAP is its simplicity, both in terms of implementation and operation. This simplicity, however, comes at the cost of security.

Unlike more secure protocols like [CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol)](../protocols/chap.md), PAP does not use a repeated challenge-response mechanism and authenticates only once at the beginning of the session. Since PAP transmits the password in clear text and does not use random challenges, it offers no protection against replay attacks, where an attacker can capture the password and use it later.

Setting up PAP is relatively straightforward, requiring only the configuration of the username and password on both the client and server.

PAP is considered a legacy protocol. While it's still in use in certain older or less secure environments, it's not recommended for any scenario where data security is a concern. More secure authentication protocols, such as CHAP and [EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)](../frameworks/eap.md), are generally preferred over PAP in modern network setups.
