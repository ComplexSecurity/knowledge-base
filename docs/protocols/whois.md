WHOIS is a widely used internet protocol and database system that provides information about [domain names](../web/fqdn.md), [IP addresses](../networking/ipa.md), and other resources on the internet.

It serves as a public directory for domain registration and ownership information. WHOIS data includes details about domain registrants, domain registration dates, domain name servers ([DNS](../networking/dns.md)), and administrative and technical contacts associated with a domain.

WHOIS provides information about the owner of a domain name, including their name, organization, email address, postal address, and phone number. This data can be valuable for verifying the legitimacy of a website, contacting the domain owner for legitimate purposes, or conducting due diligence before engaging in online transactions.

WHOIS records include information about when a domain name was registered, its expiration date, and the domain registrar responsible for managing it. This information can help assess the age and history of a domain, which may be relevant in various investigations.

WHOIS data also includes technical contact details, which can be useful for reaching out to the individuals or entities responsible for managing the technical aspects of a domain, such as DNS configuration and server administration.
