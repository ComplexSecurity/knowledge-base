The Signal Protocol is an advanced cryptographic protocol used for end-to-end encryption in messaging applications. It was developed by Open Whisper Systems and is most notably used in the Signal app, but its technology has also been implemented in other messaging services like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype.

The protocol ensures that messages are encrypted on the sender's device and remain encrypted until they reach the intended recipient's device. This means that no intermediary, not even the service provider, can read the messages.  he Signal Protocol uses ephemeral keys for each message, ensuring that even if a key is compromised in the future, it cannot be used to decrypt past messages. This property is known as [[Perfect Forward Secrecy|forward secrecy]].

The protocol employs a technique called the "double ratchet" algorithm, which combines a [[Diffie-Hellman]] key exchange and a symmetric-key ratchet based on the KDF chain. This mechanism allows for secure and continual updating of encryption keys.

The Signal Protocol supports asynchronous messaging environments, meaning it works even when one of the parties is offline. New keys are generated when users go offline and come back online. The protocol has been extended to provide end-to-end encryption for group chats, not just one-on-one conversations.

The components are:

- [[X3DH (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman)]]: A key agreement protocol used for establishing a shared secret between two parties in an asynchronous environment. It's used to set up secure sessions between users.
- Signal's [[Double Ratchet Algorithm]]: Provides end-to-end encryption for subsequent messages after the session has been established. It ensures that each message has a unique encryption key, enhancing security.

Signal Protocol is primarily known for its use in the Signal messaging app, but its adoption extends to other major messaging platforms, ensuring secure communication for billions of users.

The Signal Protocol operates in the background of applications, so users don't interact with it directly. However, the process can be conceptualized as follows:

1. **Session Setup**: When two users start a chat, their devices use the Signal Protocol to agree on a set of keys for encryption and decryption.
2. **Message Transmission**: Each message is encrypted with a unique key, and upon receipt, the recipient's device decrypts the message using the corresponding key.
3. **Key Ratcheting**: As the conversation progresses, the keys are continually updated, ensuring each message's encryption is unique and secure.
