Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) is the latest version of the [[WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)|Wi-Fi Protected Access]] security protocol, introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance in 2018. WPA3 provides more robust and secure wireless network encryption than its predecessor, [[WPA2]].

WPA3 uses the [[Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)]] protocol, which provides stronger protections against offline dictionary attacks compared to the [[Pre-Shared Key (PSK)]] method used in WPA2.

WPA3 offers enhanced security for users on open public networks through individualized data encryption. This means that data transmitted over a public Wi-Fi network is encrypted uniquely for each user, reducing the risk of eavesdropping.

The SAE mechanism in WPA3 makes it more difficult for attackers to perform brute-force attacks by limiting the data they receive in response to incorrect password attempts. WPA3 provides forward secrecy, ensuring that if an attacker captures encrypted data but later cracks the network password, they still cannot decrypt previously captured traffic.

WPA3 includes Wi-Fi Easy Connect, which simplifies the process of connecting devices with limited or no display interface (like [[IoT]] devices) to a Wi-Fi network using a secondary device, such as a smartphone.

WPA3-Enterprise offers a 192-bit security suite aligned with the [[Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite]], providing additional protection for networks transmitting sensitive data.

While WPA3 is a significant advancement, it is designed to coexist with WPA2, allowing a gradual transition for devices and networks. The Wi-Fi Alliance requires WPA3 certification for all Wi-Fi 6 devices, ensuring that the latest devices meet the highest security standards.

WPA3-Enterprise Mode ensures that networks are using the strongest cryptographic protocols available, which is particularly important for government, defense, and industrial applications.

As of its introduction, WPA3 is in a transition phase, with many devices still using WPA2. Over time, as more devices support WPA3, it is expected to become the dominant Wi-Fi security standard.
