The Post Office Protocol (POP) is an Internet standard protocol used by local email software clients to retrieve emails from a remote mail server over a [[TCP-IP|TCP/IP]] connection. 

POP3 provides access to an inbox stored in an email [[Server|server]]. It executes the download and deletes operations for messages. Thus, when a POP3 client connects to the mail server, it retrieves all messages from the mailbox. Then it stores them on your local computer and deletes them from the remote server.

!!! info
    Modern POP3 clients allow you to keep a copy of your messages on the server if you explicitly select this option.
