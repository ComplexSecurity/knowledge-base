ActiveSync is a synchronization protocol developed by Microsoft that enables mobile devices to synchronize data with [Microsoft Exchange Server](../misc/mes.md). It's widely used to sync email, calendar events, contacts, tasks, and other information between mobile devices and enterprise servers, ensuring that users have consistent access to important data across all their devices.

ActiveSync allows for the synchronization of emails, calendar information, contacts, tasks, and notes between servers and mobile devices. This feature enables real-time synchronization of emails and other data. When new data is available, it's automatically "pushed" to the mobile device without the user having to manually sync or pull the data.

ActiveSync allows administrators to enforce security policies on devices connected to the Exchange Server, such as password requirements, data encryption, or remote wipe capabilities in case the device is lost or stolen.

The protocol is designed to be efficient in terms of data transmission and battery usage, making it practical for use on mobile devices. ActiveSync has been widely adopted by various mobile device manufacturers and is supported on a range of platforms, including iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.

ActiveSync is primarily used to provide access to enterprise email on mobile devices, ensuring that users stay connected while on the go. It keeps calendar events and contacts up to date across desktop and mobile devices, which is crucial for business users.

ActiveSync is a key component in enterprise mobility, allowing employees to access corporate data securely from their personal or company-provided mobile devices.

In Microsoft Exchange environments, ActiveSync plays a vital role in enabling mobile access to Exchange mailboxes. It's a core feature of Exchange Server and Exchange Online (part of [Microsoft 365](../misc/m365.md)).

While ActiveSync facilitates data access on mobile devices, it also raises security considerations, particularly in terms of data protection and access control. Enterprises using ActiveSync typically implement policies and security measures to mitigate potential risks associated with mobile data access.
