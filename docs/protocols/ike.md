IKE (Internet Key Exchange) is a protocol used in [[IPsec]] (Internet Protocol Security) for ensuring secure, authenticated key exchange and establishing [[Security Associations (SAs)]]. IKE plays a crucial role in setting up the cryptographic parameters for securing IP communications.

IKE automates the process of generating, exchanging, and managing cryptographic keys required for IPsec, and also negotiates the IPsec Security Associations (SAs) parameters. 

IKE is a fundamental part of the IPsec suite, which provides secure encrypted communication over IP networks. While IPsec handles the actual encryption and decryption of data, IKE ensures that secure keys are used and agreed upon by both parties.

IKE operates in two phases:

- **Phase 1**: Establishes a secure channel between the two parties for further negotiation. This phase authenticates the two endpoints and sets up a secure, encrypted channel by exchanging and agreeing on encryption and authentication methods.
- **Phase 2**: Negotiates the IPsec SAs parameters to establish the actual IPsec tunnel. This phase uses the secure channel established in Phase 1 to negotiate the details of the IPsec connection, including which encryption and integrity algorithms to use.

IKE uses key exchange protocols like Diffie-Hellman to establish shared secrets between the two parties, ensuring that the keys are not exposed to any eavesdroppers.

IKE supports multiple authentication methods, including pre-shared keys, digital certificates, and public key cryptography, to ensure that both communicating parties are who they claim to be. IKE establishes SAs, which are agreements on how IPsec will encrypt and authenticate packets. An SA includes all the parameters needed for execution of encryption and authentication operations.

There are two versions of IKE â€“ IKEv1 and IKEv2. IKEv2 is a newer version that simplifies the protocol and improves upon the security features of IKEv1. It also offers better support for NAT traversal.

IKE includes mechanisms for [[Network Address Translation (NAT)]] traversal, which is important for enabling IPsec traffic to pass through NAT devices commonly used in internet routing.

IKE is widely used in setting up VPN ([[Virtual Private Network]]) connections, allowing secure and authenticated communication over untrusted networks like the internet.
