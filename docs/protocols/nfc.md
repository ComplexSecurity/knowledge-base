Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within close proximity, typically 4 cm (1.6 in) or less. It evolved from [[Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)]] technology.

NFC is designed for short-range communication, with a typical maximum distance of about 4 cm, ensuring secure communication. Unlike RFID, which is primarily one-way, NFC allows for two-way communication between devices. This means both devices can send and receive information.

NFC involves two types of devices - 'passive' (like NFC tags that don't require power) and 'active' (like smartphones that can read and write to NFC tags and communicate with each other). One of NFC's primary benefits is its simplicity. A connection is established quickly and easily by simply bringing two devices close together.

Common uses of NFC include contactless payments, data transfer, and simplified setup of longer-range wireless communications such as [[Bluetooth]] and Wi-Fi. It is also used for social networking, for sharing contacts, photos, videos, or files, and in interactive advertising.

NFC is widely used for mobile payment systems, like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay, allowing users to make secure transactions without needing physical cards.

NFC tags can be embedded in smart objects and used in the Internet of Things ([[IoT]]) for tasks like inventory management or asset tracking.
