MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight and open messaging protocol designed for small sensors and mobile devices with high-latency or unreliable networks. It is commonly used in scenarios where low bandwidth, high latency, or an unreliable network is a concern. MQTT follows a publish/subscribe model and is known for its simplicity and efficiency. 

MQTT operates on a publish/subscribe messaging pattern. In this model, devices or applications can publish messages to a specific topic, and other devices or applications subscribe to receive messages on that topic. This decouples the sender (publisher) from the receiver (subscriber).

MQTT uses a broker-based architecture. The broker is a server that acts as an intermediary between publishers and subscribers. It receives messages from publishers and forwards them to the appropriate subscribers based on topics. The broker helps in managing the communication flow.

Topics are string identifiers used to categorize and route messages. Publishers specify a topic when sending a message, and subscribers express interest in specific topics to receive relevant messages. Topics provide a flexible and scalable way to organize communication.

MQTT supports different levels of Quality of Service for message delivery:
- QoS 0: At most once delivery (fire and forget).
- QoS 1: At least once delivery (guaranteed delivery, but messages may be duplicated).
- QoS 2: Exactly once delivery (ensures that the message is delivered exactly once by using a handshake mechanism).

MQTT supports the concept of retained messages. When a message is sent with the "retain" flag, the broker stores the last message sent on a specific topic. Subscribers joining later will receive the most recent retained message for that topic.

MQTT is designed to be lightweight, making it suitable for devices with limited resources, such as sensors and [IoT](../terms/iot.md) devices. The protocol minimizes the amount of overhead associated with communication.

MQTT is connectionless, meaning that clients (publishers and subscribers) do not need to maintain a continuous connection to the broker. Clients can connect, send or receive messages, and then disconnect. While MQTT itself does not define security mechanisms, it can be used in combination with secure transport protocols such as [TLS/SSL](../cryptography/ssltls.md) for encryption. Additionally, authentication mechanisms can be implemented at the application level.

MQTT has gained popularity in the Internet of Things (IoT) space due to its efficiency and scalability. It is well-suited for scenarios where devices need to communicate with each other or with a central server in a distributed and resource-constrained environment.
