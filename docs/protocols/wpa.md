Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security protocol developed for securing wireless computer networks. It was created to provide a robust security solution to replace the original and less secure [[Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)]] standard. WPA and its subsequent versions, [[WPA2]] and [[WPA3]], are used to safeguard Wi-Fi networks.

WPA was introduced in 2003 by the Wi-Fi Alliance to replace WEP. It uses [[Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)]] for encryption, which dynamically changes keys to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

WPA supports two modes of authentication - Personal ([[WPA-PSK]]) and Enterprise ([[WPA-EAP]]). The personal mode uses a [[Pre-Shared Key (PSK)]], while the enterprise mode uses an authentication server.
