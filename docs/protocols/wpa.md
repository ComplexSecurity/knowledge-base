Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security protocol developed for securing wireless computer networks. It was created to provide a robust security solution to replace the original and less secure [Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)](../protocols/wep.md) standard. WPA and its subsequent versions, [WPA2](../protocols/wpa2.md) and [WPA3](../protocols/wpa3.md), are used to safeguard Wi-Fi networks.

WPA was introduced in 2003 by the Wi-Fi Alliance to replace WEP. It uses [Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)](../cryptography/tkip.md) for encryption, which dynamically changes keys to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

WPA supports two modes of authentication - Personal ([WPA-PSK](../protocols/wpa-psk.md)) and Enterprise ([WPA-EAP](../protocols/wpa-eap.md)). The personal mode uses a [Pre-Shared Key (PSK)](../cryptography/psk.md), while the enterprise mode uses an authentication server.
