The Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) is an authentication and negotiation protocol used to establish secure communication between client and server applications in networked environments. SPNEGO is primarily associated with the [Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSSAPI)](../misc/gssapi.md) and is often used in the context of web-based applications and services.

SPNEGO is designed to enable the negotiation of authentication mechanisms between a client and a server, allowing them to select a common and mutually acceptable authentication method for secure communication. It provides a standardized way for clients to communicate their supported authentication mechanisms to servers and for servers to select the most appropriate method from the client's list.

SPNEGO enables the negotiation of authentication mechanisms without requiring prior knowledge of the client's capabilities. It allows the client to indicate the supported authentication mechanisms it can use for secure communication. SPNEGO promotes interoperability between different authentication protocols and mechanisms, such as [Kerberos](../activedirectory/kerb.md), [NTLM](../security/ntlm.md), and others. It ensures that client and server applications can communicate securely even if they support different authentication methods.

SPNEGO is commonly used in [HTTP](../web/http.md) environments, often in conjunction with the [Negotiate Authentication](../web/neg.md) mechanism. This integration allows web browsers and servers to negotiate and use authentication methods such as Kerberos or NTLM for securing HTTP-based communication.

SPNEGO relies on the exchange of security tokens between the client and server. These tokens contain information related to the selected authentication mechanism and are used to establish secure communication. SPNEGO facilitates Single Sign-On solutions, allowing users to log in once and gain access to multiple services or applications without repeated authentication.

SPNEGO is designed to work in various computing environments and is not tied to any specific platform or operating system. This promotes compatibility between different systems and applications. SPNEGO is based on industry standards and is defined in RFC 4178 (published by the Internet Engineering Task Force), ensuring that implementations adhere to a common specification.

SPNEGO is designed to provide secure authentication and communication. It helps protect against unauthorized access and eavesdropping attacks.
