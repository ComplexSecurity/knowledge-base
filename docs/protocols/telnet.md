Telnet is a network protocol that gives users an unsecure way to access a computer over a network. Telnet is a network protocol that allows a user to remotely access and control another computer over the Internet or local area network (LAN). It enables a user to establish a connection to a remote system and perform tasks as if they were sitting in front of that computer.

It is a [client](../terms/client.md)-[server](../terms/server.md) protocol. It uses [TCP](../networking/tcp.md) as its underlying transport protocol.

One of the key features of Telnet is that it is platform-independent, which means that it can be used to connect to a variety of different operating systems and computers. Therefore, it is a valuable tool for system administrators and developers who need to manage remote systems from different locations.

One of the main differences between Telnet and [SSH](../protocols/ssh.md) is the level of security. Telnet transmits data in clear text, which means that anyone with access to the network can potentially intercept and read the data, including passwords and sensitive data. On the other hand, SSH encrypts data transmission, making it much more safe and secure than Telnet.
