A binary protocol is a communication protocol that uses binary data encoding for transmitting data over a network. Unlike text-based protocols that use readable text formats (like [[HTTP Protocol|HTTP]], which uses [[ASCII]] text for communication), binary protocols represent data in binary form, which is more efficient for computers to parse and process.
  
In binary protocols, data is encoded as sequences of bytes. These bytes represent various types of information, such as commands, identifiers, lengths, and actual data payloads.

Binary protocols are generally more efficient than text-based protocols in terms of data size and processing speed. They require less bandwidth and are faster for computers to parse because they are closer to the machine's native language.

Binary protocols are commonly used in situations where performance and efficiency are critical. This includes internal communication in distributed systems, database query protocols, file transfer protocols, and communication in high-performance computing environments.

Examples of binary protocols include the [[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)]], [[Google's Protocol Buffers (protobuf)]], the [[Remote Procedure Call]] protocol (RPC), and many database protocols like [[MySQL]]’s client/server protocol.

While binary protocols are efficient, they can be more complex to implement and debug compared to text-based protocols. Reading and interpreting binary data requires specific tools and understanding of the protocol’s structure.

In custom network protocol design, binary protocols are often favored for their efficiency. However, careful planning is required to define the protocol's structure and handling mechanisms. Like any protocol, binary protocols need to be designed with security in mind, including considerations for encryption, authentication, and data integrity.
