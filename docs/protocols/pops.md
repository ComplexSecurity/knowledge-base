POP3 Secure, often referred to as POP3S, is an enhanced version of the [[Post Office Protocol]] version 3 (POP3), designed to provide secure email retrieval. POP3 is a standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve emails from a [[server]], but in its basic form, it doesn't include any encryption or security mechanisms. POP3 Secure addresses this limitation by adding a layer of security to the POP3 protocol.
