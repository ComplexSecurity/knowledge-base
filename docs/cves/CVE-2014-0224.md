# CVE-2014-0224

CVE-2014-0224 - OpenSSL ‘ChangeCipherSpec’ MiTM Vulnerability

This module checks for the OpenSSL ChangeCipherSpec (CCS) Injection vulnerability. The problem exists in the handling of early CCS messages during session negotiation. Vulnerable installations of OpenSSL accepts them, while later implementations do not. If successful, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by downgrading the cipher spec between a client and server. This issue was first reported in early June, 2014.

## Examples

```bash
$ nmap --script ssl-ccs-injection -p 443 10.10.10.1

|       length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and
|       consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via
|       a crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.
