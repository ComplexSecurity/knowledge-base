Impacket's `smbserver` is a script in the [Impacket](../tools/impacket.md) suite that allows you to set up a simple SMB ([Server Message Block](../protocols/smb.md)) server on your machine. This can be incredibly useful for various network operations and penetration testing scenarios where you need an SMB server for file sharing, file transfer, or exploitation tasks.

It allows for the quick setup of an SMB server without the need for complex configuration or additional software beyond [Python](../programming/python.md) and Impacket. You can use it to share files across the network, making it useful for transferring files to and from a target during a penetration test or network administration tasks.

`smbserver` supports different versions of the SMB protocol, enhancing its compatibility with various Windows versions. In penetration testing, it can be used to host payloads, capture hashed credentials, or serve as part of an exploitation chain.

A basic usage example:

```bash
python smbserver.py SHARE_NAME /path/to/shared/folder
```

- `SHARE_NAME` is the name of the SMB share that will be created.
- `/path/to/shared/folder` is the local path to the directory that you want to share over SMB.

!!! info
    Once run, this command will start an SMB server on your machine, sharing the specified folder under the given share name. Other machines on your network can then access this share.
