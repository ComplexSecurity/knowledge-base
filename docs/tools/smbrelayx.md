Impacket's `smbrelayx` is a tool designed for performing [[SMB relay attacks]]. An SMB relay attack is a type of security exploit where an attacker intercepts and relays SMB ([[Server Message Block]]) authentication requests from one computer to another on the network. This tool is part of the [[Impacket]] suite, a collection of [[Python]] classes and tools for working with network protocols.

The primary function of `smbrelayx` is to relay SMB authentication sessions from one host to another. It captures the authentication request from one machine and forwards it to a second machine, effectively impersonating the first machine. `smbrelayx` facilitates a [[Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack|man-in-the-middle (MitM)]] position where it can intercept and manipulate SMB traffic.

One of the significant aspects of SMB relay attacks is that the attacker doesn't need to know the user's password. The tool uses the authentication session itself to gain access. Once authentication is relayed and access is gained, `smbrelayx` can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the target machine.

An example of how you might use Impacket's `smbrelayx` in a command-line environment:

```bash
python smbrelayx.py -h <TARGET_IP> -e /path/to/executable
```

- `-h <TARGET_IP>`: The IP address of the target machine where you want to relay the SMB authentication.
- `-e /path/to/executable`: Path to an executable file that will be run on the target machine upon successful relay.

!!! info
    In a typical SMB relay attack scenario, the attacker would need to be in a position to intercept SMB traffic, which might involve [[ARP poisoning]] or other network manipulation techniques.
