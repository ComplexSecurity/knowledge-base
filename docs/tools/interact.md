"Interactsh" is an open-source project available on GitHub, described as an "OOB (Out-of-Band) interaction gathering server and client library." This tool is primarily used in cybersecurity and penetration testing for detecting OOB [data exfiltration](../security/exfil.md) and interaction capabilities. 

Interactsh can be related to [Cross-Site Scripting](../web/xss.md) (XSS) in the context of security testing and vulnerability assessment. XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. In such scenarios, Interactsh can be used to identify and demonstrate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.

For instance, during penetration testing, a security researcher might use an XSS payload that triggers an interaction with the Interactsh server when executed in a victim's browser. This interaction, captured by Interactsh, serves as proof of the vulnerability, helping to assess the risk and impact of the XSS issue. By monitoring out-of-band interactions, Interactsh helps in detecting and analyzing such security flaws in web applications.
