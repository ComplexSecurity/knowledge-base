Dig is a command-line tool and utility for querying [[DNS]] (Domain Name System) servers to retrieve information about domain names, [[IP address|IP addresses]], DNS records, and other DNS-related data.

The name "dig" stands for "domain information groper." It is commonly used on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS, for DNS troubleshooting, network diagnostics, and DNS-related tasks.
