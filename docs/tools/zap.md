OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source tool used for identifying security vulnerabilities in web applications. It is developed by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), a prominent organization in the field of web security. 

ZAP is primarily used by security professionals and developers to test the security of web applications by automatically detecting a range of security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. 

It also allows for manual testing, offering features like intercepting [proxy](../terms/proxy.md) and various types of scans to analyze and manipulate the traffic between a user's browser and the web server.
