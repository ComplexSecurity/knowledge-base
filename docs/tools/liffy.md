Liffy, short for Local File Inclusion Exploiter, is a tool designed to exploit [[Local File Inclusion]] (LFI) vulnerabilities in web applications. LFI is a common security vulnerability that allows an attacker to include and execute files on a server through a web application.

Liffy is specifically tailored to identify and exploit LFI vulnerabilities. It can help in automating the process of testing and exploiting these weaknesses in web applications. The tool usually includes various techniques to exploit LFI vulnerabilities, such as [[directory traversal]], [[Log Poisoning]], and leveraging [[PHP wrappers]].

Liffy can be used to test web applications for LFI vulnerabilities, validating the security measures in place and identifying potential areas for improvement. In some cases, Liffy or similar tools might be able to leverage LFI vulnerabilities to achieve [[remote code execution]], especially if combined with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
