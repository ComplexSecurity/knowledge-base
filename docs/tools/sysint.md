The Sysinternals Suite is a collection of powerful system utilities and diagnostic tools for Microsoft Windows, created by Mark Russinovich and Bryce Cogswell.

These utilities are designed to help manage, troubleshoot, and diagnose Windows systems and applications. They are widely used by system administrators, IT professionals, and security experts for in-depth analysis of Windows systems.

Some key tools include:

1. [Process Explorer](): Provides detailed information about running processes and [DLLs]() that they have loaded, which is more comprehensive than the standard Windows Task Manager.
2. [Process Monitor](): An advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry, and process/thread activity.
3. [Autoruns](): Shows which programs are configured to run during system bootup or login, and the full list of Registry and file system locations available for auto-start configuration.
4. [TCPView](): Displays detailed listings of all [TCP]() and [UDP]() endpoints on your system, including the local and remote addresses and state of TCP connections.
5. [Sysmon (System Monitor)](): Provides advanced monitoring and logging capabilities that help detect malicious activity and aid in understanding how intruders may have breached a system.
6. [BgInfo](): Automatically displays relevant information about a Windows computer on the desktop's background.
