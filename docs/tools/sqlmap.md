SQLMap is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting [SQL injection]() flaws and taking over of database servers. It provides a powerful testing environment for SQL injection, which is a common security vulnerability in web applications.

SQLMap can detect and enumerate various types of SQL injection vulnerabilities, including [boolean-based blind](), [time-based blind](), [error-based](), [UNION query-based](), and [stacked queries]().

It can exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities to take over the database server. This means it can execute arbitrary commands on the server, access the underlying file system, and retrieve data from the database.

SQLMap works with a wide range of database systems, such as [MySQL](), [Oracle](), [PostgreSQL](), [Microsoft SQL Server](), [Microsoft Access](), [IBM DB2](), [SQLite](), [Firebird](), [Sybase](), and [SAP MaxDB]().
