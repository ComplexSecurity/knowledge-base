Aquatone is a tool used in cybersecurity, specifically in the field of reconnaissance and information gathering. It is primarily designed for penetration testers and security researchers to collect various kinds of information about a [domain](../web/fqdn.md).

Aquatone is a tool for visual inspection of websites across a large amount of hosts and is convenient for quickly gaining an overview of HTTP-based attack surface.

It allows users to discover domains and [subdomains](../web/subs.md) of a target organization. It uses various [OSINT](../security/osint.md) sources and techniques to find as many domains as possible.

One notable feature is its ability to take screenshots of websites which is useful for quickly visualizing the web services running on different domains and subdomains discovered during the reconnaissance phase.

It can also perform [port scanning](../security/portscan.md) to identify open [ports](../networking/port.md) on target servers. It can also gather information about the technologies used on web servers, such as web server software, [content management systems](../web/cms.md) and other technologies, similiar to things like [Wappalyzer](../tools/wapp.md) or [WhatWeb](../tools/whatweb.md).
