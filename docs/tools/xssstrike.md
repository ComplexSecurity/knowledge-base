"XSS Strike" is a tool specifically designed for detecting and exploiting [XSS](../web/xss.md) vulnerabilities in web applications.

XSS, which stands for Cross-Site Scripting, is a common security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. XSS Strike is used in the field of web application security, particularly in penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, to identify and demonstrate the presence of XSS vulnerabilities.

XSS Strike scans web applications to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities where malicious scripts could be injected. It goes beyond detection, providing mechanisms to exploit identified XSS vulnerabilities. This can help in demonstrating the potential impact of the vulnerability.
