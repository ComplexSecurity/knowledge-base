tcpdump is a widely-used command-line network packet analyzer or sniffer program that captures network packets transmitted over a network and displays their contents in a detailed format. It's available on most Unix-like operating systems.

It can capture all types of packets on network interfaces, including [TCP](../networking/tcp.md), [UDP](../networking/udp.md), [ICMP](../networking/icmp.md), and others.
