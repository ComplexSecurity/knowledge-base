Burp Extender is a part of [Burp Suite](../tools/burpsuite.md), which is a comprehensive platform for performing security testing of web applications. Burp Suite is developed by PortSwigger and is widely used by security professionals and ethical hackers for web application penetration testing. Burp Extender is a specific component within this suite that allows users to extend the functionality of Burp Suite through custom plugins.

Burp Extender allows users to write their own extensions to add new functionality or integrate existing processes into Burp Suite. These extensions can be used to automate tasks, extend Burp Suite's capabilities, or integrate third-party tools. 

Extensions for Burp Extender can be written in [Java](../programming/java.md), [Burp Extender](../tools/extend.md), or [Ruby](../programming/ruby.md), offering flexibility for developers familiar with these languages. Burp Extender provides an [API](../terms/apis.md) (Application Programming Interface) that exposes various functionalities of Burp Suite, allowing extensions to interact with Burpâ€™s tools and workflows.

The security community actively develops and shares extensions, which means users can leverage a wide range of tools created by other security professionals. Extensions can include anything from custom scanners and fuzzers to more specialized functions tailored to specific testing requirements.

Some common uses include:

- **Automated Testing**: Writing extensions to automate repetitive tasks in security testing.
- **Customized Attack Scenarios**: Creating tools for specific attack types that might not be covered in-depth by the standard Burp Suite tools.
- **Data Manipulation**: Extensions can be used to manipulate request and response data in real-time for specific testing needs.
- **Integration with Other Tools**: Extending Burp Suite to work seamlessly with other software and tools used in the security testing process.
