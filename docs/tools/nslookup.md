The name server lookup (nslookup) command-line tool finds the [IP Address]() address or [DNS]() record for a specific hostname. This command also supports reverse DNS lookups by inputting the IP addresses of the domains to be looked up.

The nslookup tool can be used for DNS-related tasks like server testing and troubleshooting.
