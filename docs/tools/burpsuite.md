Burp Suite is a [[Web Proxies|proxy]] program that enables us to track, examine, and alter requests made by our browsers before they are forwarded to a distant server.

Burp Suite is a prominent web application security solution. It gives us the ability to manually test for vulnerabilities, intercepts HTTP messages, and change a message's body and header.

It is the most widely used tool among experts in online app security and bug bounty hunters. It is a better option than free substitutes like [[OWASP ZAP]] because of how simple it is to use. The community edition of Burp Suite is accessible for free, whereas the professional edition and the enterprise edition need payment.
