Windows PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language built on the [.NET Framework](). PowerShell extends the capabilities of the traditional [Command Prompt]() and provides a more powerful and flexible toolset for managing and automating Windows systems.

Unlike the traditional batch scripts of Command Prompt, PowerShell uses a more advanced scripting language that is object-based, not text-based. This allows for more complex and powerful scripts.

PowerShell is widely used for automating administrative tasks, managing system configurations, accessing and controlling various Windows components, and handling large numbers of systems efficiently.

PowerShell operations are performed using cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets"), which are specialized .NET classes implementing particular operations. These cmdlets can be combined, modified, and extended within scripts for complex tasks.

PowerShell provides access to the underlying .NET Framework, allowing for sophisticated operations and integration with a wide range of applications and services.

After gaining initial access to a system, hackers often use PowerShell for post-exploitation tasks because of its deep integration with Windows environments and its ability to interact with various system components. Malicious PowerShell scripts can be used to execute attacks, gather information, or move laterally within a network.
