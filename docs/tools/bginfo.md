BgInfo, part of the [Sysinternals Suite](../tools/sysint.md) by Microsoft, is a utility that displays system configuration information on the Windows desktop background. It is primarily used for administrative purposes rather than for hacking or penetration testing.

BgInfo can show various system details such as IP address, system name, logged-in user, operating system version, CPU, memory, and network information on the desktop background. Users can configure which pieces of information are displayed and customize the appearance (location, font, color, etc.) on the desktop.

If a penetration tester gains access to a system where BgInfo is running, the displayed information can quickly provide valuable insights about the system's configuration, network settings, and user details.

In an internal penetration test, understanding the configuration of various systems within an organization can help in identifying potential targets and vulnerabilities. BgInfo can expedite this process by making key system information readily visible. Knowledge about system configurations, obtained via tools like BgInfo, can aid in crafting more convincing [social engineering](../security/soceng.md) attacks.
