Nmap is short for Network Mapper. It is an open-source Linux command-line tool that is used to scan [IP addresses](../networking/ipa.md) and [ports](../networking/port.md) in a network and to detect installed applications.

Nmap allows network admins to find which devices are running on their network, discover open ports and services, and detect vulnerabilities.

Nmap helps you to quickly map out a network without sophisticated commands or configurations. It also supports simple commands (for example, to check if a host is up) and complex scripting through the Nmap scripting engine.

Other features of Nmap include:

- Ability to quickly recognize all the devices including [servers](../terms/server.md), routers, switches, mobile devices, etc on single or multiple networks.
- Helps identify services running on a system including web servers, [DNS](../networking/dns.md) servers, and other common applications. Nmap can also detect application versions with reasonable accuracy to help detect existing vulnerabilities.
- Nmap can find information about the operating system running on devices. It can provide detailed information like OS versions, making it easier to plan additional approaches during penetration testing.
- During security auditing and vulnerability scanning, you can use Nmap to attack systems using existing scripts from the Nmap Scripting Engine.
- Nmap has a graphical user interface called Zenmap. It helps you develop visual mappings of a network for better usability and reporting.
