WAFW00F is a tool designed to help identify and fingerprint [Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)](../security/waf.md) that are protecting a website. WAFs are security solutions that monitor and filter [HTTP](../web/http.md) traffic to and from a web application to protect it against various types of attacks such as [SQL injection](../security/sqli.md), [cross-site scripting](../web/xss.md) (XSS), and others.

It works by sending a series of HTTP requests that are crafted in specific ways to a target website. Based on the responses, it attempts to determine whether a WAF is present and which one.

Different WAFs have unique ways of responding to malicious or malformed traffic. Wafw00f analyzes these responses to figure out the type of WAF in use including popular ones like [ModSecurity](../security/modsec.md), [Cloudflare](../web/cloudflare.md), [AWS WAF](../cloud/aws-waf.md) and others.
