  
"**TheHarvester**" is a popular open-source information gathering tool used by cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and penetration testers during the reconnaissance phase of security assessments. 

It is designed to collect information and discover potential targets, assets, and online presences associated with a particular domain or organization. 

The Harvester can help gather data from various online sources, including search engines, public databases, and [DNS](../networking/dns.md)-related services. This information can be valuable for assessing an organization's attack surface and identifying potential vulnerabilities.

It can search for emails associated with a target domain by querying search engines, social media and public websites. It can also enumerate [subdomains](../web/subs.md) of a target using DNS [brute-forcing](../security/brute.md) or by querying public DNS servers.

The tool can also attempt to identify live hosts associated with a domain by conducting DNS queries and [port scanning](../security/portscan.md) to determine which IPs are responsive.

It supports multiple data sources, including search engines, public [APIS](../terms/apis.md) and services like Shodan, PGP key servers and more.
