XSSer, short for "Cross Site Scripter," is an open-source penetration testing tool specifically designed for detecting and exploiting [Cross-Site Scripting]() (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications.

XSS vulnerabilities are security flaws that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. XSSer is part of the arsenal of tools used by security professionals, such as penetration testers and ethical hackers, to assess the security of web applications.

XSSer automates the process of sending various payloads to a target web application to test for different types of XSS vulnerabilities, including [reflected](), [stored](), and [DOM-based XSS]().

It comes with a payload generator that can create various types of encoded and obfuscated scripts designed to bypass basic security filters and reveal vulnerabilities. XSSer can crawl websites to automatically discover points where XSS payloads can be injected, such as forms and URL parameters.
