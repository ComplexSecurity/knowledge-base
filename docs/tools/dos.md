Invoke-DOSfuscation is a [PowerShell](../tools/ps.md) v2.0+ compatible framework designed for cmd.exe command obfuscation. It is intended to counter attackers who use obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems that rely heavily on command line argument values.

The framework enables defenders to generate thousands of uniquely obfuscated sample commands to test and improve their detection capabilities against such techniques.

The tool's usage involves several components built into standalone formal functions. The primary function, **Invoke-DOSfuscation**, is the easiest way for users to explore and visualize the obfuscation techniques supported by the framework.
