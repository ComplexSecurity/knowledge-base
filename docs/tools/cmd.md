The Windows Command Line, often referred to as Command Prompt or cmd.exe, is a command-line interface in Microsoft Windows operating systems. It provides a way to execute commands and perform various tasks through textual input and output, as opposed to using a graphical user interface (GUI).

The Command Prompt is a text-based interface where users type commands and receive text-based output. It is used for executing system commands, running scripts, and managing files and services.

The Command Line uses specific syntax for commands. Common commands include `dir` (to list files in a directory), `cd` (to change directories), `copy` (to copy files), and `del` (to delete files), among others.

Users can write batch files (.bat or .cmd files), which are scripts of multiple commands that run sequentially. Batch files are used for automating repetitive tasks. The Command Line is a powerful tool for system administration. It provides commands for managing system resources, configuring network settings, performing diagnostics, and troubleshooting.

In addition to the traditional Command Prompt, Windows also offers [PowerShell](../tools/ps.md), a more powerful command-line shell and scripting language. PowerShell extends the capabilities of the Command Line with more complex operations and scripting.
