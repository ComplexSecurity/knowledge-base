LFISuite is a security tool designed to exploit and detect [[Local File Inclusion]] (LFI) vulnerabilities in web applications. Local File Inclusion is a common security vulnerability that occurs when a web application allows an attacker to include files on a server through the web browser. This can lead to unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive data.

LFISuite typically provides automated ways to exploit LFI vulnerabilities. It can automatically test for these vulnerabilities in a web application. It usually includes a range of techniques to exploit LFI vulnerabilities, such as [[directory traversal]], [[null byte injection]], and other methods commonly used in LFI attacks.

The tool can be used to extract sensitive data from the server, such as password files, configuration files, and other critical data accessible through the file system. Some versions of LFISuite or similar tools might also attempt to escalate the LFI vulnerability to execute commands on the server, leading to [[Remote Code Execution]] (RCE) if the server is misconfigured.
