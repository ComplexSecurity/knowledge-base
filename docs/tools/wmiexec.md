Impacket's `wmiexec` is a tool within the [Impacket](../tools/impacket.md) suite that allows for the execution of commands on Windows systems using the [Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)](../misc/wmi.md) service. It provides a semi-interactive shell for running commands remotely on Windows machines. This tool is particularly useful in penetration testing and network administration for executing commands on remote systems without needing to deploy an agent.

Some key features include:

1. **Command Execution via WMI**: Executes Windows commands remotely using WMI, a Windows management service.
2. **Semi-Interactive Shell**: Provides a shell-like interface to run commands on the remote system.
3. **No Agent Required**: Unlike some remote execution tools, `wmiexec` doesn't require you to install an agent on the target system; it only needs appropriate credentials and network access.
4. **Supports Authentication**: Compatible with [NTLM](../security/ntlm.md) authentication, allowing it to work in typical Windows network environments.

An example of how you might use Impacket's `wmiexec` to run commands on a remote Windows machine. This assumes you have Impacket installed and network access to the target machine:

```bash
python wmiexec.py 'DOMAIN/username:password'@<TARGET_IP_ADDRESS>
```

After running this command, you will be presented with a command-line interface where you can type and execute commands on the remote machine. For example:

```powershell
C:\> ipconfig /all
```

!!! info
    This would display the IP configuration details of the remote machine.
