Proxychains is a tool used in Unix-like systems to redirect the network traffic of applications through proxy servers. It allows users to mask their actual [IP address](../networking/ipa.md) and route their internet traffic through one or several [proxy](../terms/proxy.md) servers. 

This tool is commonly used in penetration testing (pentesting) for various purposes.

When used in combination with other tools, proxychains can help in accessing and assessing internal networks that are not directly accessible from the internet. 

For example, if a penetration tester has compromised an external machine that has access to an internal network, they can use proxychains to route their traffic through the compromised machine.
