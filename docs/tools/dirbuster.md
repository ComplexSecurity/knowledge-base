DirBusterÂ is a Java application that performs a [brute force](../security/brute.md) attack on directories and filenames on the web application. It can use a file containing the possible file and directory names or generate all possible combinations.

DirBuster uses a list produced by surfing the internet and collecting the directory and files that developers use in real-world web applications. DirBuster, which was developed by OWASP, is currently an inactive project and is provided now as a ZAP attack tool rather than a standalone tool.
