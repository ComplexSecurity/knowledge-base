WhatWeb is an open-source web fingerprinting tool used for web application discovery and profiling.

It is designed to help identify and gather information about web applications and websites by analyzing their response [headers](../web/headers.md), [HTML](../web/html.md), [JavaScript](../programming/js.md), and other web page components.

WhatWeb is particularly useful for reconnaissance and passive information gathering during web application security assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments.

1WhatWeb uses a collection of signature-based techniques to "fingerprint" web applications and identify the technologies, frameworks, and software components they use.

This can include web servers, [content management systems](../web/cms.md) (CMS), programming languages, JavaScript libraries, and more.

While primarily focused on [HTTP](../web/http.md) and [HTTPS](../web/https.md), WhatWeb can also analyze other web-related protocols and services, such as [FTP](../protocols/ftp.md), [SSH](../protocols/ssh.md), and [SMB](../protocols/smb.md), to gather information about a target.
