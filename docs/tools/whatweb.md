WhatWeb is an open-source web fingerprinting tool used for web application discovery and profiling.

It is designed to help identify and gather information about web applications and websites by analyzing their response [headers](), [HTML](), [JavaScript](), and other web page components.

WhatWeb is particularly useful for reconnaissance and passive information gathering during web application security assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments.

1WhatWeb uses a collection of signature-based techniques to "fingerprint" web applications and identify the technologies, frameworks, and software components they use.

This can include web servers, [content management systems]() (CMS), programming languages, JavaScript libraries, and more.

While primarily focused on [HTTP]() and [HTTPS](), WhatWeb can also analyze other web-related protocols and services, such as [FTP](), [SSH](), and [SMB](), to gather information about a target.
