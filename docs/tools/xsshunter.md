XSSHunter is a tool designed for detecting and analyzing [[Cross-Site Scripting]] (XSS) vulnerabilities. It's commonly used by security researchers and penetration testers to identify areas where an application might be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

XSSHunter works by providing a specialized payload that can be injected into target web applications. When the payload is executed as part of an XSS attack, it sends information back to XSSHunter, allowing the researcher to see how the payload interacted with the web application.

This feedback includes details such as [[Cookies|cookie]] data, the origin of the script execution, and other context that is useful for understanding the scope and impact of the vulnerability. XSSHunter is particularly valuable for detecting [[blind XSS]] vulnerabilities, where immediate feedback is not visible in the application's response.
