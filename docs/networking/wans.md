A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area, typically to connect multiple [Local Area Networks (LANs)](lans.md) or other types of networks. WANs are used to connect devices that are far apart, often in different cities or countries, making them essential for global business operations and communications. 

Unlike LANs, which cover a small area like a single building or campus, WANs can span cities, states, or even continents. This wide reach allows for long-distance communication and data sharing.

WANs can be built using various types of connections, including leased lines, broadband (such as DSL), fiber optics, and satellite communications. The choice depends on factors like bandwidth requirements, cost, and geographic reach.

WANs can be public (using shared or carrier-owned resources like the internet) or private (dedicated lines or [Virtual Private Network]() that provide private, secure connections over public infrastructure).

WANs use technologies like MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching), ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), and Frame Relay for efficient data transfer.

VPNs are often used over WANs to provide secure communication channels, especially when transmitting sensitive data over the public internet.

    The internet is the largest example of a WAN, connecting billions of devices worldwide.

Many organizations use WANs to connect their various office locations, enabling efficient communication and resource sharing among different branches.

Factors like latency, bandwidth, and packet loss are significant performance considerations in WANs, impacting the speed and reliability of data transmission.

Building and maintaining a WAN, especially a private one, can be costly due to the required infrastructure and technologies. This has led to the popularity of cloud-based solutions and services.

Techniques and technologies for WAN optimization are used to increase data transfer efficiencies across the network. This includes traffic shaping, data deduplication, and compression.
