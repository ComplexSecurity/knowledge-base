Data Center Bridging (DCB) is a suite of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards that enhance traditional Ethernet networking to make it more suitable for data center environments.

These enhancements are particularly focused on enabling Ethernet networks to carry mixed types of traffic, such as storage, data, and high-performance interconnects, with improved reliability, efficiency, and low latency. DCB is crucial for technologies like [[FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet)]] and [[iSCSI]], as well as [[RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)]].

Some key components include:

1. **Priority-based Flow Control (PFC)** - IEEE 802.1Qbb:
   - Provides a link-level flow control mechanism that can prevent packet loss due to congestion. PFC allows for pause frames to be sent for specific classes of traffic, preventing packet drops without impacting other traffic.
2. **Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS)** - IEEE 802.1Qaz:
   - Allows for the allocation of bandwidth on a network link to different traffic classes. It ensures that critical traffic gets the necessary bandwidth, improving network management and efficiency.
3. **Data Center Bridging Exchange (DCBX)**:
   - A discovery and capability exchange protocol used for conveying configuration and capabilities of the DCB features between neighbors (such as switches and endpoints), ensuring consistent configuration across the network.
4. **Quantized Congestion Notification (QCN)** - IEEE 802.1Qau:
   - A mechanism to manage network congestion by providing feedback to the endpoints sending data, allowing them to adjust their transmission rate to alleviate congestion.

DCB enables converged network environments where storage, LAN, and cluster traffic can coexist on the same Ethernet network, reducing the need for separate infrastructures. For storage traffic protocols like FCoE and iSCSI, DCB ensures lossless transmission, which is crucial for storage operations.

By managing flow control and congestion, DCB supports low-latency operations, essential for high-performance computing and real-time applications. DCB provides a standardized way to implement these advanced features, ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different devices and vendors.
