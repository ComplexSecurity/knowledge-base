Routers are hardware devices or software programs in a computer network that direct data packets between different networks, ensuring that the data sent across the Internet or a local network reaches the correct destination. They play a crucial role in managing and directing internet traffic.

Routers analyze the data packets sent across a network and determine their destination based on the packet's [IP address](ip.md). They then use information in their routing table to decide the best path for the packet to take.

Routers are primarily used to connect multiple networks together. In home settings, they typically connect a local network to the Internet. In enterprise settings, they might connect various [local area networks (LANs)](lans.md) to [Wide Area Network (WAN)](wans.md).

Many routers provide [[Network Address Translation (NAT)](nat.md), which allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing the Internet. This helps in conserving the number of public IP addresses used and adds a layer of security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks.

Routers manage network traffic, helping to prevent congestion and ensuring data packets are efficiently routed. They can prioritize certain types of traffic over others, a concept known as Quality of Service (QoS).

Many modern routers also function as wireless access points (WAPs), allowing Wi-Fi-enabled devices to connect to the network wirelessly. Routers often include [firewall]() functions to block unwanted traffic from entering the network. They can also offer additional security features like [[Virtual Private Network|VPN]] support, traffic logging, and parental controls.

Routers usually provide [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)](dhcp.md) services, assigning IP addresses to devices on the network automatically.
