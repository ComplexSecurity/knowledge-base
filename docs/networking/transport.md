The Transport Layer is responsible for error-free delivery of information between devices. It is also responsible for flow control and sequencing. The information that traverses this layer is known as a "segment".

It ensures end-to-end communication services for applications and provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers via segmenting data, acknowledging data receipt and error-recovery.

Some protocols that operate here are:

- [User Datagram Protocol]() (UDP)
- [Transmission Control Protocol]()(TCP)
