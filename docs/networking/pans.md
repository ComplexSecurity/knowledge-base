Personal Area Networks (PANs) are networks used for communication among computer devices, including telephones and personal digital assistants, within a range of a few meters or about 30 feet. The primary purpose of a PAN is to facilitate data transmission among devices close to a single user.

PANs are designed to cover a small area, typically within the immediate vicinity of a user. They are not meant for large-scale network coverage like [Local Area Networks (LANs)](lans.md) or [Wide Area Network (WAN)](wans.md).

They enable the interconnection of devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables (like smartwatches), and peripheral devices (like keyboards, mice, and printers). PANs can be wireless (WPANs) or wired. Wireless PANs are the most common, utilizing technologies like [Bluetooth](), Infrared, and Wi-Fi Direct. Wired PANs might use USB or FireWire connections.

In wireless PANs, especially those using Bluetooth or Infrared, the emphasis is on low power consumption and short-range communication, suitable for personal device connectivity.

Common uses include file transfers between devices, internet sharing from a phone to a laptop, wireless keyboards and mice connecting to computers, and fitness trackers syncing data with smartphones.

Security in PANs is crucial, especially in wireless setups, to protect data during transmission. Technologies like Bluetooth incorporate security measures like encryption and authentication.

Technologies like Bluetoothand [Near Field Communication (NFC)]() are prevalent in establishing WPANs for quick and efficient device-to-device communication.
