A Local Area Network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. It is one of the most common types of networks used for data communications.

LANs are designed for small geographical areas. They are typically confined to a single building or a group of closely situated buildings like a campus or business park. LANs offer high data transfer rates within the network, typically ranging from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps or more, depending on the technology used.

Devices commonly used in LANs include routers, switches, hubs, and network cables. In [Wireless LANs (WLANs)](../networking/wlans.md), Wi-Fi technology and wireless access points are used.

LANs can be either wired, using Ethernet cables, or wireless, commonly using Wi-Fi technology. Wired LANs typically offer greater speed and security, while wireless LANs offer more flexibility and mobility.

One of the primary purposes of a LAN is to enable the sharing of resources and files among multiple users. This includes sharing printers, file storage, and applications. LANs often provide internet access through a single shared connection. Devices on the LAN can connect to the internet using a router or modem.

Security within a LAN includes [firewall](../security/firewall.md), network security protocols, and potentially [Network Access Control (NAC)](../security/nac.md) systems to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

While LANs are limited in size, they can be connected to other LANs over any distance via telephone lines and radio waves to form a [Wide Area Network (WAN)](../networking/wlans.md).
