The TCP/IP model is a part of the network domain designed specifically for overseeing efficient and error-free transmission of data.

The model works on a four-layered architecture model, where each layer implicit the required network protocols on the data to be transmitted, which remodels the data to the most optimum structure for efficient transmission over the network.

It is an alternative to the [[OSI Model]] and has four different layers as opposed to the seven the OSI model have:

- Application layer - groups up the [[Application Layer]], [[Presentation Layer]] and [[Session Layer]] under one group.
- Transport layer - equal to the OSI Model [[Transport Layer]]
- Internet layer - equal to the OSI Model [[Network Layer]]
- Network Access layer - groups up the [[Data Link Layer]] and [[Physical Layer]]
