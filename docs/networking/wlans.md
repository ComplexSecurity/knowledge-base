A Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is a type of local area network that uses wireless communication methods to connect devices within a limited area such as a home, school, office building, or campus. WLANs provide the same functionality as traditional [Local Area Networks (LANs)](../networking/lans.md) but without the physical constraints of needing network cables.

WLANs typically use Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) technology to enable wireless communication. Wi-Fi is based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards. The main components of a WLAN include a wireless router or access point and wireless-enabled devices like laptops, smartphones, tablets, and printers.

In a WLAN, devices connect to the internet or exchange data with each other by linking to a wireless access point, which is in turn connected to a physical, wired network. WLANs are typically designed to cover a small geographical area like a home, office, or campus building. The range can be extended with additional access points or signal boosters.

One of the primary advantages of WLANs is the mobility they offer. Users can move around within the coverage area and maintain network connectivity.

WLANs are generally easier and less expensive to install and configure than traditional wired LANs, as they require no cabling between computers and network devices.

Security is a critical concern in WLANs. Technologies like [WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)](../protocols/wpa.md), [WPA2](../protocols/wpa2.md), and [WPA3](../protocols/wpa3.md) are used to secure wireless communications.

While WLANs offer the convenience of wireless access, their speeds and bandwidth might be lower compared to wired LANs, especially in areas with signal interference.

WLANs are widely used in homes, businesses, and public hotspots. They facilitate easy access to the internet and organizational resources for mobile users. WLANs can be affected by interference from other wireless devices and physical barriers. The reliability and quality of the wireless signal can be influenced by factors such as distance from the access point, building materials, and other electronic devices.
