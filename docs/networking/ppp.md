The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a [data link layer](../networking/datalink.md) (Layer 2) communication protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes in a network. It enables the transmission of data packets over serial point-to-point links such as telephone lines, fiber optic links, or satellite transmission paths.

PPP is widely used for establishing internet connections via dial-up modems, DSL, and other types of broadband connections.

PPP is designed to encapsulate various network layer protocols (like IP) for transmission over a point-to-point link. It can dynamically assign or negotiate the [IP address](../networking/ipa.md), netmask, and other necessary configuration parameters.

LCP (Link Control Protocol) is a part of PPP that establishes, configures, and tests the data-link connection. It handles the initial setup of the link and its termination.

After the LCP phase, PPP uses different NCPs to allow for the transmission of multiple network layer protocols simultaneously over the PPP link. Each network layer protocol (like IP, IPX, or AppleTalk) has its corresponding NCP.

PPP supports various authentication protocols to ensure that the connection is being made with an authorized device. These include [PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)](../protocols/pap.md), [CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol)](../protocols/chap.md), and [EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)](../frameworks/eap.md).

PPP includes error detection mechanisms to check whether data has been transmitted accurately across the link. However, it does not attempt error correction; instead, it relies on higher-layer protocols for this purpose.

PPP can operate over both asynchronous (like traditional phone lines) and synchronous (like ISDN) media, making it versatile for various types of point-to-point connections. PPP also supports a multilink feature where multiple physical links can be combined to act as a single logical link. This is useful for increasing bandwidth and reliability.

PPP can negotiate and use compression protocols to increase the throughput of the PPP connection. In addition to its traditional use in direct point-to-point connections, PPP is also used in VPN ([Virtual Private Network](../security/vpns.md)) scenarios, encapsulated within other protocols like L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol).
