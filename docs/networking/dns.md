DNS, or Domain Name System, is like the internet's phonebook. When you type a website address, like **www\.google\.com** into your browser, your computer doesn't understand the words. Instead, it needs a number called an [IP Address](../networking/ipa.md) to find the website.

DNS is the system that converts the website name into this IP address. It's like looking up someone's name in a phonebook to find their telephone number. Without DNS, you'd have to remember complicated numbers for every website you want to visit. DNS makes it easy by letting us use simple, memorable names.

These DNS requests are called "queries".
