FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) is a network technology that encapsulates Fibre Channel frames over Ethernet networks. This allows Fibre Channel to use 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks (or higher speeds) while preserving the Fibre Channel protocol. FCoE was developed to integrate the high-speed data transfer capabilities of Fibre Channel with the flexibility and ubiquity of Ethernet.

FCoE enables the convergence of data and storage networking. This allows organizations to use a single network infrastructure for both SAN (Storage Area Naetwork) and [Local Area Networks (LANs)](lans.md) traffic, reducing hardware, cabling, and management costs.

FCoE preserves the Fibre Channel protocol, ensuring compatibility with existing Fibre Channel networks and devices. This allows for a seamless integration of new technology into existing data center infrastructures. It leverages high-speed Ethernet (10 Gbps or higher) for storage networking, which can provide improved bandwidth and reduced latency compared to traditional Fibre Channel.

FCoE requires a lossless Ethernet environment to function correctly. This is typically achieved through [Data Center Bridging](datacenterbridging.md) capabilities, which add flow control and congestion notification features to standard Ethernet.

FCoE is primarily used in data center environments where there is a need to consolidate network and storage infrastructure without sacrificing performance. In environments requiring high-speed data access and transfer, FCoE offers a way to combine high-speed networking with robust storage connectivity. FCoE is well-suited for virtualized data centers, offering flexibility and scalability in managing network and storage resources.
