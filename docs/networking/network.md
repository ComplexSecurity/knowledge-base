The Network Layer is responsible for logical addressing and routing on a network. Logical addressing methods include those defined by IPv4 and IPv6. The information traversing this layer is known as a "packet".

This layer manages the delivery of packets, including routing through different routers in the network. It is responsible for packet forwarding and addressing. The main responsibility is to carry data packets from the source to the destination.

Some examples of protocols used at this layer include:

- [IP Address (IPv4)](../networking/ipa.md)
- [IP Address (IPv6)](../networking/ipa.md)
- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
- Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
