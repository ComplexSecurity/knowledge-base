A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system. Each port is associated with a specific process or service and there are [[default ports]] for common services. 

Ports allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of traffic: emails go to a different port than webpages, for instance, even though both reach a computer over the same Internet connection.

Ports are standardized across all network-connected devices, with each port assigned a number. WhileÂ [[IP Address|IP addresses]] enable messages to go to and from specific devices, port numbers allow targeting of specific services or applications within those devices.

Ports are a [[transport layer]] concept. Only a transport protocol such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] or [[User Datagram Protocol]] can indicate which port a packet should go to.
