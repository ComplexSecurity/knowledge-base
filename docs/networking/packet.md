A "**packet**" refers to a unit of data that is transmitted across a network. When information is sent over the Internet, it is broken down into smaller, manageable units known as packets. These packets contain not only the data being transmitted but also important control information such as:

1. **Source and Destination Addresses:** These indicate where the packet is coming from and where it is going. This helps in routing the packet across the network to reach its intended destination.
2. **Sequence Information:** This is used to reassemble the packets in the correct order when they reach their destination, as packets can arrive out of order.
3. **Error Checking Data:** This is used to verify that the packet arrived intact and without corruption during the transit.
4. **Protocol Information:** This indicates the type of protocol (like [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](../networking/tcp.md), [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](../networking/udp.md), etc.) used for communication, which dictates how data is treated.
