A DNS zone transfer is a process used in [DNS](../networking/dns.md) to replicate DNS records across a network of DNS servers. It is a mechanism by which a DNS server can update its DNS records to match those of another DNS server.

In a zone transfer, there are two types of servers involved:

- Primary DNS Server - known as master server, it holds the original read-write version of the zone file.
- Secondary DNS Server - known as slave server, it holds a read-only copy of the zone file. It receives updates from the primary through zone transfers.

The secondary server periodically checks with the primary server to see if any changes have been made to the DNS records. If there have been changes, the secondary server requests a zone transfer. The primary server then sends a copy of the zone file.

There are two main types of DNS zone transfers:

- AXFR (Full Zone Transfer) - complete transfer of the DNS zone file from the primary to the secondary server, used when the secondary server needs to sync its data from scratch.
- IXFR (Incremental Zone Transfer) - involves transferring only the changes made to the DNS records since the last successful transfer.

Zone transfers can pose risks if not properly configured. Unauthorized access to DNS zone data can lead to [DNS spoofing](../security/dspoof.md) or other DNS-based attacks. Zone transfers are often restricted to specific, authorized secondary servers.

The zone file contains various types of DNS records, such as [DNS A Records](../networking/a.md), [DNS MX Records](../networking/mx.md), [DNS NS Records](../networking/ns.md) and [DNS CNAME Records](../networking/cname.md).

In the context of cybersecurity and penetration testing, testing for improperly configured DNS zone transfers is common, as it can reveal a wealth of information about internal network structures and systems.
