The Session Layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining and terminating data communications between applications or devices. 

Sessions are made up of requests and responses. It identifies the data as belonging to a particular session and ensures that the requests and responses are sent back and forth between the two parties.

Some protocols that operate at this layer include:

- [Password Authentication Protocol]() (PAP)
- [Microsoft Remote Procedure Call]() (RPC)
