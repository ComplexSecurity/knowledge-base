The Presentation Layer is responsible for converting and representing the payload in different formats. For example, data-based, character-based, image-based, audio-based, video-based and so on.

It formats and encrypts data to be sent across the network. It takes care that the data is sent in such a way that the receiver will understand the information and will be able to use the data efficiently and effectively.

It ensures that data sent from the application layer of one system is readable by the application layer of another system. This includes data encryption, decryption, and compression. Some formats that can be used here are:

- Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)
- Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
- Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG)
- QuickTime
