DHCP, which stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is a network management protocol used on IP networks. It automates the process of configuring devices on the network with [IP Address](../networking/ipa.md) and other related configuration information.

DHCP allows network administrators to automate the assignment of IP addresses to devices (known as clients) on the network. This saves the effort of manually assigning an IP address to each device.

When a device connects to the network, it sends a broadcast request for configuration information. The DHCP server receives this request and assigns an IP address from a pool of available addresses (known as a DHCP pool). Along with the IP address, the DHCP server also provides other necessary configuration information such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and [DNS](../networking/dns.md) server addresses.

DHCP typically leases IP addresses to devices for a specified period. After the lease expires, the IP address is returned to the pool for reassignment. If the device remains connected, it can request to renew the lease.

By automating IP address management, DHCP simplifies network setup and management, especially in environments where devices frequently join and leave the network, like in Wi-Fi networks.

DHCP helps prevent IP conflicts, where two devices might otherwise be manually configured with the same IP address, leading to network communication issues. Administrators can configure DHCP settings according to the needs of their network, including the range of IP addresses in the DHCP pool, lease duration, and other options.

DHCP operates on a [Client-Server Architecture](../terms/csa.md) model. The DHCP client on the device requests network configuration details, and the DHCP server provides this information. It supports a wide range of devices, including computers, smartphones, and [IoT](../terms/iot.md) devices, making it versatile for various network environments.
