A hostname is essentially a label assigned to a device connected to a computer network. It's used to identify the device in various forms such as the Internet, within local networks or in software systems. Hostnames are part of the [Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)](../web/fqdn.md) which uniquely identifies a device on the network.
