Client-server architecture is a computing model that segregates the client (or front-end) from the server (or back-end), each performing specific functions within a network. This model is a fundamental concept in networked, distributed computing and forms the backbone of most modern web and business applications.

The client and server communicate over a network. The client sends a request to the server, the server processes the request, and then returns a response. This communication is often facilitated by protocols like [HTTP](../web/http.md) for web applications.
