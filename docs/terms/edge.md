Edge computing refers to a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth. It represents a shift from traditional centralized and cloud-based systems to decentralized processing at the edge of the network.

In edge computing, data processing occurs near the source of data generation (like [IoT](../terms/iot.md) devices or local edge servers), rather than being transmitted to a distant, centralized data center or cloud.

By processing data locally, edge computing reduces latency, or the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction. This is crucial for real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and smart cities.

It minimizes the need to send large volumes of data over the network, reducing bandwidth usage and associated costs. Processing data locally can enhance privacy and security, as sensitive data doesn’t need to traverse over the network to a remote server.

Edge computing allows organizations to scale their computing resources by adding more edge devices, rather than expanding central data centers. It is ideal for situations where real-time data processing and decision-making are critical, such as in emergency response systems or on-site medical diagnostics.

Edge computing is particularly significant in the IoT ecosystem. With billions of devices connected, sending all data to the cloud for processing is impractical due to latency and bandwidth considerations.

Edge computing can provide more resilience in case of network issues, as local processing ensures functionality even with intermittent cloud connectivity. Common applications include smart grid control, traffic management systems, agricultural sensors, retail analytics, and augmented reality (AR) experiences.

Edge computing complements cloud computing; it doesn’t replace it. Many architectures use edge computing for immediate processing, while the cloud is used for longer-term storage and analysis. Additionally, edge computing can leverage AI and machine learning algorithms for faster processing and analytics.
