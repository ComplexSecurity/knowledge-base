The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical objects - "things" - that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household items to sophisticated industrial tools.

IoT devices are often equipped with sensors that can collect and send data over the internet. These sensors can detect various environmental factors like temperature, motion, light, etc. 

Devices in an IoT ecosystem are connected to the internet, allowing them to send and receive data. This connectivity can be via Wi-Fi, [Bluetooth](../misc/bt.md), cellular networks, or other means.

The data collected by IoT devices can be stored and analyzed to extract useful information. This processing can happen on the device itself ([Edge Computing](../terms/edge.md)) or in a centralized cloud-based service.

IoT enables the automation of daily tasks and processes. Devices can be programmed to make decisions and perform actions based on the data they collect.

IoT has a wide range of applications, including smart home devices (like smart thermostats and lights), wearables (like fitness trackers), smart cities (traffic control, waste management), healthcare (patient monitoring), agriculture (crop monitoring), and [Industrial IoT (IIoT)](../terms/iiot.md) for manufacturing and supply chain management.

With the increasing number of connected devices, security and privacy issues are a major concern. Ensuring the security of IoT devices and the data they handle is critical. IoT allows for the real-time monitoring and management of systems and environments, which is particularly valuable in industrial and urban settings.

Many IoT applications focus on increasing energy efficiency, whether it's through smart grids in urban areas or optimized machinery in industrial settings.
