Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to the application of the Internet of Things ([IoT](../terms/iot.md)) technologies in industrial sectors and applications. It involves the use of smart sensors, advanced connectivity, and big data analytics to improve operational efficiency, productivity, and performance in industrial settings.

IIoT uses intelligent machines and sensors to gather detailed and precise data in real-time from industrial operations. This data can include information about the performance, efficiency, and health of machines.

IIoT devices are interconnected, often using wireless technologies, allowing for seamless communication and data exchange between machines and systems.

The data collected by IIoT devices are analyzed, often in real-time, to monitor performance, predict maintenance needs, and identify inefficiencies. This analysis can lead to actionable insights to optimize processes.

IIoT enables predictive maintenance, where machinery is maintained based on data-driven indicators of wear or failure, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

By automating and optimizing processes, IIoT can significantly increase operational efficiency and productivity in industrial settings. IIoT is used in manufacturing, supply chain logistics, energy management, mining, oil and gas, agriculture, and other industrial sectors.

In the manufacturing sector, IIoT is a key component of smart factories, where it enables automation, real-time monitoring, and optimization of manufacturing processes.

IIoT integrates with enterprise systems like ERP ([Enterprise Resource Planning](../misc/erpapps.md)) and SCM ([Supply Chain Management](../misc/supply.md)) to provide a holistic view of operations and support better decision-making.

As industrial systems are increasingly connected, they become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hence, robust cybersecurity measures are essential in IIoT environments.

To process data efficiently, IIoT often relies on [Edge Computing](../terms/edge.md), which processes data near the source of data generation, reducing latency and reliance on constant cloud connectivity.

IIoT is a cornerstone of Industry 4.0, which represents the ongoing automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, including cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, and cognitive computing.
