Curve448 is a modern elliptic curve used in public-key cryptography, known for its high security level and efficiency. It is also referred to as "Goldilocks" curve, a name that suggests it's "just right" in terms of balancing security and performance. Curve448 is part of a family of curves that includes [Curve25519](../cryptography/25519.md), another popular curve used in cryptography.

The primary feature of Curve448 is its 448-bit key size, which offers a very high level of security. It's designed to be resistant against current foreseeable cryptographic attacks, including those using quantum computers. Despite its large size, Curve448 is designed for efficient computation, making it practical for use even in environments where computing resources are constrained.

Curve448 is constructed to minimize common pitfalls in elliptic curve cryptography, such as issues with weak keys or side-channel attacks. Its design choices aim to simplify secure implementations.

Curve448 is recommended for use in various cryptographic protocols. For instance, it's one of the curves specified for use in [TLS](../cryptography/tls.md) (Transport Layer Security) 1.3, which is the protocol underlying secure web communications.

Curve448 can be used for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over an unsecured channel, providing confidentiality for subsequent communications. In conjunction with algorithms like [EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm)](../cryptography/eddsa.md), Curve448 is used for creating digital signatures. For example, [Ed448](../cryptography/448.md)uses Curve448 for high-security signature needs.

In a cryptographic application, using Curve448 might involve operations like key generation, key exchange, and digital signatures, though the specific implementations would rely on cryptographic libraries that handle the complex mathematics involved. For instance:

- In a TLS 1.3 handshake, Curve448 might be used to securely agree on a shared secret between a client and a server, enabling encrypted communication.
- In a digital signature scenario, Ed448 (which uses Curve448) would be used to sign and verify messages, ensuring their authenticity and integrity.
