Curve25519 is a state-of-the-art elliptic curve offering high security and great performance, particularly designed for use in [[elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)]].

Curve25519 is designed to be resistant to a wide array of cryptographic attacks, including the most common ones like timing attacks. Its design choices, such as a large prime field and specific curve construction, contribute to its robustness against attacks.

It offers fast performance, especially in comparison to older elliptic curves. This efficiency makes it particularly suitable for systems with limited computational resources, like mobile devices. Curve25519 has a simple mathematical structure, which reduces the complexity of implementation and minimizes the risk of security flaws.

Curve25519 is most commonly used for [[Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)|ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)]] key exchange, allowing two parties to securely establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. It's used in a variety of encryption protocols and software, including [[TLS]], [[Signal Protocol]] [[Tor]], and many others.

Curve25519 forms the basis for several cryptographic algorithms and protocols:

- **ECDH Key Exchange**: The most common use of Curve25519 is in the ECDH algorithm for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.
- **Ed25519**: This is a signature scheme derived from Curve25519 (though it technically uses a different curve called "Edwards25519" for technical reasons). Ed25519 is known for its strong security and high-speed operation.
- **Encryption and Digital Signatures**: In addition to key exchange, Curve25519 and its variants are used for encryption and creating digital signatures in various cryptographic systems.

A conceptual example of using Curve25519 in an ECDH key exchange process might look like this:

```python
# Pseudo-code example
alice_private_key = generate_private_key()
alice_public_key = curve25519(alice_private_key)

bob_private_key = generate_private_key()
bob_public_key = curve25519(bob_private_key)

# Alice and Bob exchange public keys over an insecure channel

# Both generate a shared secret
alice_shared_secret = curve25519(alice_private_key, bob_public_key)
bob_shared_secret = curve25519(bob_private_key, alice_public_key)

# alice_shared_secret and bob_shared_secret should be the same
```
