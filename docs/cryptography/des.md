DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. Developed in the early 1970s and adopted as a federal standard for encryption in the United States in 1977, DES has historically been influential in the advancement of modern cryptography. However, it is now considered outdated and insecure for many applications.

DES is a [Symmetric Encryption](../cryptography/symmetric.md) algorithm, which means the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data. DES operates on 64-bit blocks of data, meaning it encrypts and decrypts data in 64-bit chunks.

Despite operating on 64-bit blocks, DES uses a 56-bit key (plus 8 bits for parity), which was initially believed to offer sufficient security. However, the key size is now considered too small to withstand modern brute-force attacks.

DES employs a [Feistel Network](../cryptography/fes.md), a specific method of breaking the [plaintext](../security/clear.md) into two halves and then performing operations (like substitution and permutation) on them. In the encryption process, DES applies a series of 16 rounds or iterations of substitution and permutation operations, which form the core of the algorithm.

The DES encryption process starts and ends with initial and final permutations (IP and FP), which are fixed and known.

DES can be used in various modes of operation, including [Electronic Codebook (ECB)](../cryptography/ebc.md), [Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)](../cryptography/cbc.md), and others, to enhance its security for different applications.

The major vulnerability of DES is its relatively small key size, making it feasible to crack the encryption using brute-force attacks. This was demonstrated in the late 1990s. To overcome the limitations of DES, [Triple DES (3DES)](../cryptography/3des.md) was developed, which applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block. 3DES significantly increases security and has been widely used as a more secure alternative.

    DES was officially withdrawn as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2005 and replaced by the [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](../cryptography/aes.md), which offers greater security.
