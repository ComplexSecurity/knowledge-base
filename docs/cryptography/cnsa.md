The Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, previously known as the Suite B Cryptography, is a set of cryptographic algorithms recommended by the National Security Agency (NSA) for the protection of US government data classified up to the level of Top Secret.

It's part of the NSA's initiative to secure national security systems with robust encryption standards.

The CNSA Suite is designed to protect sensitive national security information and systems. It provides guidelines on cryptographic algorithms that are deemed secure and effective for safeguarding such information.

The suite includes algorithms for encryption, digital signatures, key exchange, and hashing. These are intended to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of sensitive data.

The suite recommends the use of strong encryption standards. For example, it endorses [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)]] with key sizes of 128 bits or higher for encrypting classified information.

For key exchange and digital signatures, the suite includes public key cryptographic standards such as [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)]]. CNSA recommends using secure hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or higher for ensuring data integrity.

The CNSA Suite is an evolution from the earlier Suite B Cryptography, reflecting advancements in cryptographic research and the changing landscape of cybersecurity threats.

While the CNSA Suite is intended for national security systems, its recommendations are often followed by commercial products and systems that require a high level of security, especially those used in government contracting.

Organizations and entities that deal with classified or sensitive government data are often required or advised to implement the CNSA Suite to ensure compliance with NSA guidelines.
