Electronic Codebook (ECB) is a mode of operation for a block cipher, where a [[Clear-Text|plaintext]] is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately. This method of encryption, while straightforward, has several weaknesses, especially when dealing with large amounts of data or data with repetitive patterns.

In ECB, the plaintext is divided into blocks of a fixed size, and each block is encrypted independently using the same key. The size of each block is determined by the block cipher being used.

Since each block is encrypted independently, there is no dependency or linkage between the blocks. The same plaintext block will always encrypt to the same ciphertext block when using the same key.

One of the major weaknesses of ECB is that it does not hide data patterns well. Identical blocks of plaintext result in identical blocks of ciphertext. This can be a security risk if the plaintext contains repetitive or structured data.

A benefit of ECB is that it allows for parallel processing of blocks, which can be an advantage in terms of encryption and decryption speed.

Due to its vulnerabilities, ECB is generally not recommended for encrypting large amounts of data, particularly data with patterns. It might be used for small, random, and unstructured pieces of data.

In ECB mode, each block is independent; therefore, an error in one block during transmission does not affect other blocks. This can be advantageous in certain scenarios where error correction is vital.

ECB is the simplest encryption mode and is relatively easy to implement. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of security. Given its vulnerability to pattern analysis, ECB mode is not suitable for encrypting confidential or sensitive data over networks.

The weakness of ECB is often demonstrated with bitmap images. When an image is encrypted using ECB, the outlines and contours of the image can sometimes still be discerned, revealing information about the original.

More secure modes of operation, like [[Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)]], [[Counter (CTR)]], or [[Galois Counter Mode (GCM)]], are generally preferred over ECB, as they introduce an element of randomness and link the blocks of ciphertext.
