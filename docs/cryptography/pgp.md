PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for securing emails, files, and other forms of data transmission.

PGP uses a combination of [[Symmetric Encryption|symmetric-key cryptography]] and [[Asymmetric Encryption|public-key cryptography]]. This hybrid approach provides the benefits of both methods: the efficiency of symmetric-key encryption and the secure key distribution of public-key encryption.

When sending an encrypted message, PGP first compresses the plaintext. It then encrypts the compressed message using a symmetric encryption algorithm with a one-time, randomly generated key (known as the session key).

The session key is then encrypted using the recipient's public key. This encrypted session key is sent along with the encrypted message to the recipient.

The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the session key, which is then used to decrypt the encrypted message. PGP allows users to sign their messages digitally using their private key. Recipients can verify the signature using the sender's public key, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the message.

PGP uses a decentralized trust model known as the "web of trust." Unlike a [[Certificate Authorities (CAs)|Certificate Authority (CA)]] in other encryption models, PGP users endorse the validity of each other's keys. Users build a network of trust by signing and verifying each other's public keys.

Users generate a pair of keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key is shared with others to receive encrypted messages or verify digital signatures, while the private key is kept secure and is used to decrypt messages or sign messages.

Public keys can be stored on PGP key servers, making them easily accessible to anyone wanting to send an encrypted message. 

PGP is widely used for securing email communication, but it can also encrypt files, directories, and disk partitions. Itâ€™s a standard tool in secure data transmission and is often used in situations where sensitive information needs to be protected.
