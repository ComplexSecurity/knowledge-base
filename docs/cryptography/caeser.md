The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar in his private correspondence. It's named after him and is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

It involves shifting the letters of the plaintext a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The same shift is used for encrypting and decrypting the message.

The Caesar cipher can be used to [obfuscate](../security/obfuscation.md) text to hide it from casual observation. This is useful in situations where the text isn't highly sensitive but should not be immediately readable.

The Caesar cipher provides very low security. It can be easily broken with frequency analysis or brute-force attacks (trying every possible shift). Because of its simplicity and the ease with which it can be deciphered, it is not suitable for encrypting sensitive information.
