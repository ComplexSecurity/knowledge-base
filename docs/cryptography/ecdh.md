The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a variant of the [Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)](../cryptography/dsa.md) which uses elliptic curve cryptography. It was proposed for the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and is used to create a digital signature for the authentication of digital documents or data.

ECDSA employs the principles of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for digital signatures, unlike the original DSA which is based on the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields. Like DSA, ECDSA uses a pair of keys for signing (private key) and verification (public key). The private key is kept secret, while the public key is shared publicly.

One of the major advantages of ECDSA over traditional DSA is that it provides equivalent security with smaller key sizes. This results in faster computations, smaller signatures, and reduced storage requirements.

In ECDSA, a signature is generated using the signer's private key and can be verified by anyone having the corresponding public key. The signature proves the authenticity and integrity of the message.

ECDSA is widely used in various applications, especially where high security with efficient performance is required. It's employed in [SSL/TLS certificates](../web/sslcerts.md), cryptocurrency wallets (like Bitcoin and Ethereum), and other secure communication protocols.

The security of ECDSA is based on the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Breaking ECDSA requires solving this computationally difficult problem.

Different elliptic curves can be used in ECDSA, and the choice of curve affects the security and performance of the algorithm. NIST and other organizations have recommended specific curves that are considered secure and efficient.

While ECDSA offers strong security against current cryptographic attacks, like other elliptic curve-based and discrete logarithm problem-based algorithms, it is potentially vulnerable to attacks by future quantum computers.
