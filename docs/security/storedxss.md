Stored [[cross-site scripting]] (also known as second-order or persistent XSS) arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later [[HTTP Protocol|HTTP]] responses in an unsafe way.

An attacker uses Stored XSS to inject malicious content (referred to as the payload), most often JavaScript code, into the target application. If there is no input validation, this malicious code is permanently stored (persisted) by the target application, for example within a database. For example, an attacker may enter a malicious script into a user input field such as a blog comment field or in a forum post.

When a victim opens the affected web page in a browser, the XSS attack payload is served to the victimâ€™s browser as part of the HTML code (just like a legitimate comment would). This means that victims will end up executing the malicious script once the page is viewed in their browser.
