Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are comprehensive solutions used in cybersecurity to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. They are designed to give organizations an overview of the security within their IT infrastructure.

SIEM systems collect and aggregate log data generated by various sources within an organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure, such as network devices, servers, domain controllers, and applications. This data is normalized to facilitate analysis and reporting.

One of the core functionalities of SIEM is correlating events from different sources. By analyzing patterns and relationships between various log entries, SIEM can identify anomalies that might indicate a security incident.

SIEM systems analyze data in real time to detect activities that might indicate a threat. They generate alerts based on predefined and customizable rules that signal potential security issues.

SIEMs often integrate with other security solutions, such as [intrusion prevention systems]() (IPS), [Firewall|firewalls](), and endpoint protection platforms, to provide a more comprehensive security overview.
