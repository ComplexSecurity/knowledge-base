OTP stands for "One-Time Password." It is a unique, temporary password or code that is used for a single login session or transaction. OTPs provide an additional layer of security (often referred to as [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)|two-factor authentication]() or 2FA) beyond just a username and password. They are designed to combat various forms of online attacks such as phishing, credential theft, and [Brute Force Attack|brute-force attacks]().

An OTP is typically valid for only a short period of time, often a few minutes, after which it expires and cannot be used. Each OTP is unique to a specific transaction or login session.

OTPs can be generated in various ways, including:

- **Algorithm-Based**: Generated using algorithms (like [HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP)]() or [Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)]()) which can synchronize between the server and the user's device.
- **SMS or Email**: Sent to the user's registered phone number or email address.
- **Hardware Tokens**: Generated by a dedicated physical device (like a security token).
- **Software Tokens**: Generated by an authentication app on the user's smartphone (such as [Google Authenticator]() or [Authy]()).

OTPs add an extra security layer, making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access, even if they have the userâ€™s primary password. Since an OTP is only valid for one login session or transaction, it cannot be reused by an attacker.
