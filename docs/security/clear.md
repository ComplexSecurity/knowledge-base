Clear-text is also known as plaintext and simple refers to any text or data that is not encrypted or scrambled in any way. It is essentially readable and understandable as it is, without requiring any form of decoding or decryption.

In computer security, it is significant as it can be easily read by anyone who has access to it.

When data is sent over a network or stored in a database in clear-text, it poses a huge threat. If it is intercepted by unauthorized individuals, clear-text data can be used maliciously including things like credentials and personal details.
