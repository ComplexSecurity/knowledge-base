Persistence in the context of penetration testing and hacking refers to the methods used by an attacker or a penetration tester to maintain access to a system or network over a prolonged period, even through restarts, credential changes, or other disruptions. The goal of establishing persistence is to ensure continued access for ongoing exploitation, [Data Exfiltration](), or exploration.

Some common persistence techniques include:

1. Creating Backdoors: Installing backdoors in software or systems, allowing attackers to bypass normal authentication mechanisms to regain access.
    - **Example**: Inserting a [Remote Access Toolkit (RAT)]() or a [reverse shell]() script that connects back to the attacker's server.
2. Scheduled Tasks/Cron Jobs: Setting up tasks that automatically execute payloads at specified times or intervals.
    - Example: Using Windows Task Scheduler or Linux cron jobs to periodically run a script that reestablishes a connection to the attacker's machine.
3. Registry Modifications: Adding entries to the Windows Registry to execute malware or scripts at system startup.
    - **Example**: Creating a new registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` to launch a malicious executable upon user login.
4. Startup Folder: Placing scripts or executables in system startup folders which execute upon system boot or user login.
    - **Example**: Adding a script to the Windows "Startup" folder or Linux's `.bashrc` file.
5. Service Hijacking: Modifying existing legitimate services or creating new services to execute malicious code.
    - **Example**: Altering a Windows service to run a malicious executable instead of its legitimate function.
6. Implanting Rootkits: Installing [Rootkits]() that hide the attacker's activities and maintain access at a low level in the operating system.
    - **Example**: Using a kernel-mode rootkit to intercept system calls and hide the presence of an attacker's processes.
7. Account Manipulation: Creating new user accounts or adding existing accounts to privileged groups for future access.
    - **Example**: Adding a new user with administrative privileges to ensure continued access.
8. Replacing Legitimate Binaries: Swapping legitimate system binaries with modified ones that include malicious code.
    - **Example**: Replacing the `ssh` binary with a version that also logs credentials.
9. Web Shells: Placing a [web shell]() on a server to allow remote access through web requests.
    - **Example**: Uploading a [PHP]() web shell to a vulnerable web server.
