A trusted identity provider (IdP), in the context of authentication and access control, is a service or organization that is relied upon to verify and authenticate the identities of users or entities accessing a system, application, or resource. Trusted IdPs are fundamental components of various authentication and authorization systems, especially in [Single Sign-On (SSO)]() and federated identity scenarios.

The primary role of an IdP is to verify the identity of users or entities seeking access to protected resources. This verification can involve various authentication methods, such as username/password, [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](), biometrics, or token-based authentication.

Once an IdP verifies a user's identity, it issues an authentication token or assertion to the user, signifying that the user has been authenticated. This token serves as proof of the user's identity and is presented to service providers (SPs) to gain access.

Trusted IdPs play a crucial role in SSO systems. When users log in to an IdP, they can access multiple services and applications without the need to re-enter their credentials. The IdP's authentication token is used for authentication across various SPs.

In federated identity systems, multiple organizations or domains trust each other's IdPs. Users from one organization can use their home IdP's credentials to access resources in other federated domains. Trusted IdPs enable this cross-domain authentication and access. IdPs often provide additional user attributes or claims along with the authentication token. These attributes may include user roles, permissions, and profile information, which can be used by SPs for authorization and access control decisions.

A trusted IdP is expected to maintain a high level of security and trustworthiness. It should implement strong security practices, protect user data, and follow industry standards to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Trusted IdPs often conform to industry standards and protocols for authentication and identity management. Standards like [SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)]() and [OAuth]() 2.0 are commonly used in SSO and federated identity scenarios.

Examples of trusted identity providers include:

- [Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](): Azure AD is a widely used IdP that provides authentication and identity services for [Microsoft 365](), [Azure]() services, and various third-party applications.
- [Okta](): Okta is an identity and access management platform that serves as a trusted IdP for numerous organizations, allowing them to manage user identities and enable SSO.
- [Google Identity Platform](): Google provides identity and authentication services for [Google Workspace]() (formerly G Suite) and allows users to use their Google accounts for accessing third-party services.
- [Shibboleth](): Shibboleth is an open-source identity federation system often used in the academic and research community for federated identity management.
