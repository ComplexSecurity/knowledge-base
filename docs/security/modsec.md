ModSecurity, often referred to as ModSec, is a widely-used, open-source [web application firewall (WAF)](). It is designed to protect web applications from various types of attacks and vulnerabilities by monitoring and filtering [HTTP Protocol|HTTP]() traffic between a web server and clients. 

ModSecurity is commonly used with the [Apache]() HTTP server, but it does support others such as [Nginx]() and [Microsoft IIS](). It operates based on rules which allows it to inspect and intercept HTTP requests and responses.

It also provides protection against common web app threats and exploits such as [SQL injection](), [Cross-Site Scripting](), [Local File Inclusion]() and [Brute Force Attack]().
