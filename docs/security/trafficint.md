Traffic interception, also known as traffic interception or [[Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack|man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks]], refers to the unauthorized interception and possible modification of communication between two parties. This type of cyber attack is a significant security concern because it allows an attacker to intercept, read, and potentially alter the data being exchanged.

The attacker positions themselves in the communication flow between the sender and the receiver. Without the knowledge of the two legitimate parties, the attacker intercepts the data transfer.

Methods of Interception:

- [[ARP Poisoning|ARP Spoofing]]: Misusing the [[Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)]] in a [[Local Area Networks (LANs)|local area network (LAN)]] to intercept data.
- [[DNS Spoofing]]: Manipulating the Domain Name System ([[DNS]]) to redirect traffic to a malicious site or server.
- [[SSL Stripping]]: Downgrading a secure [[HTTPS Protocol|HTTP]] connection to an unencrypted [[HTTP Protocol|HTTP]] connection, making it easier to intercept the data.

Potential Impacts:

- **Eavesdropping**: Listening to private conversations or accessing sensitive data.
- **Data Modification**: Altering the data in transit, such as injecting malicious content or changing transaction details.
- [[Session Hijacking]]: Taking control of a user session after successfully capturing session tokens.
