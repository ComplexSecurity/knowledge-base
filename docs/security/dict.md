A dictionary attack is a method used in [Password Cracking]() where an attacker tries to guess passwords or phrases by systematically entering every word in a prearranged list, typically derived from a dictionary.

This type of attack is based on the assumption that many users choose common words, phrases, or simple variations of them as their passwords.

Unlike [Brute Force Attack|brute force attacks]() that try every possible combination, dictionary attacks focus on likely possibilities, making them faster and more efficient in many cases.

A dictionary can also be built using a tool like [CeWL]() to scrape the target website for relevant words.
