Role-based access control (RBAC), also known as role-based security, is a mechanism that restricts system access. It involves setting permissions and privileges to enable access to authorized users. Most large organizations use role-based access control to provide their employees with varying levels of access based on their roles and responsibilities. This protects sensitive data and ensures employees can only access information and perform actions they need to do their jobs.

An organization assigns a role-based access control role to every employee; the role determines which permissions the system grants to the user. For example, you can designate whether a user is an administrator, a specialist, or an end-user, and limit access to specific resources or tasks. An organization may let some individuals create or modify files while providing others with viewing permission only.

One role-based access control example is a set of permissions that allow users to read, edit, or delete articles in a writing application. There are two roles, a Writer and a Reader, and their respective permission levels are presented in this truth table. Using this table, you can assign permissions to each user.

Three common principles of role-based access control include:

1. **User role assignment:** The permission or access rights are granted only if the individual is assigned a role or a task.
2. **User role authorization:** The active role of the user in the task must be authorized.
3. **User role permission and access rights:** The individual can utilize their permission rights only if they’re given the authorization to perform their active role.
