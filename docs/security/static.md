Static analysis is a method of analyzing software without actually executing the program. It is conducted by examining the code to understand its structure, purpose and potential flaws. 

Static analysis involves looking at the source code or, in some cases, the compiled binary code. There are various tools that automatically perform static analysis on codebases which can check for a variety of issues including syntax errors, potential bugs and adherence to coding conventions.

Static analysis, in the context of [[Deobfuscation]], refers to a method of analyzing and understanding obfuscated code without executing it. The objective is to reverse or understand the obfuscation techniques used to make the code difficult to read or analyze, and to reveal the original, clearer form of the code or its functionality. 

In deobfuscation, static analysis is particularly useful because it allows for the safe examination of potentially malicious or complex code.

Static analysis involves a detailed inspection of the obfuscated code to identify patterns, structures and algorithms. Obfuscation can involve various techniques such as renaming variables, rearranging code structure, inserting dummy code or using complex control flow structures.
