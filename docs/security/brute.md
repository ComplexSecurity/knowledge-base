A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, and encryption keys. It is a simple yet reliable tactic for gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts and organizations’ systems and networks. 

The hacker tries multiple usernames and passwords, often using a computer to test a wide range of combinations, until they find the correct login information.

Once successful, the actor can enter the system masquerading as the legitimate user and remain inside until they are detected. They use this time to move laterally, install back doors, gain knowledge about the system to use in future attacks, and, of course, steal data.

The name "brute force" comes from attackers using excessively forceful attempts to gain access to user accounts. Despite being an old cyberattack method, brute force attacks are tried and tested and remain a popular tactic with hackers.
