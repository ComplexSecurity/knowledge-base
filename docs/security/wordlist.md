A wordlist, in the context of computing and cybersecurity, is essentially a list of words, phrases, or potential passwords. It is often used for various purposes such as password cracking, software testing, and network security.

One of the most common uses of wordlists is in [password cracking](). Attackers or security professionals use wordlists to attempt to guess passwords through methods such as [Brute Force Attack|brute force attacks]() or [dictionary attacks](). In these attacks, software systematically enters every word in the wordlist as a password to try to gain unauthorized access.

Security professionals use wordlists to test the strength of network passwords, identifying weak passwords that are vulnerable to simple dictionary attacks. Developers may use wordlists to test application responses to various inputs, ensuring that the software can handle unexpected or irregular inputs without crashing or behaving insecurely.

Wordlists can be used in data analysis or natural language processing to filter, categorize, or analyze text data.

They can contain common passwords, phrases, and alphanumeric combinations. Some wordlists are specifically tailored to certain languages, topics, or use cases. Wordlists can vary significantly in size, from thousands to millions of entries. Larger wordlists are more comprehensive but require more time and computing resources to use effectively.

Users can create custom wordlists tailored to specific targets or scenarios. For example, a wordlist for cracking corporate passwords might include terms common in the business industry. Many wordlists are freely available for download and use. However, the use of these wordlists for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.

Tools like [John the Ripper](), [Hydra](), and [Aircrack-ng]() often use wordlists to assist in password cracking and network security testing.
