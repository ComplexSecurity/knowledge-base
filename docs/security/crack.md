Password cracking is the process of attempting to gain unauthorized access to restricted systems or data by deciphering a user's password. This is often done by cybersecurity professionals for ethical purposes (like security testing) and, unfortunately, by malicious attackers as well.

The primary goal is to break into a system or retrieve data that is protected by a password by guessing or calculating the correct password.

There are different methods used including:

- [Brute Force Attack]() - trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
- [Dictionary Attacks]() - list of common words and phrases to guess passwords
- [Rainbow Table Attack]() - [Rainbow Tables|rainbow tables]() are precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions, primarily used for cracking password hashes.
- [Phishing]() - deceptive method where attackers trick users into revealing their passwords, often through fake login pages or [Social Engineering]() tactics.
