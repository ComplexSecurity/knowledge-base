Out-of-Band Data Exfiltration refers to a technique used in cyber attacks to extract data from a targeted system through a channel or path that is different from the main communication channel. This technique is often used when the direct transfer of data from the target system is not possible or is too risky due to security controls in place.

The attacker establishes a secondary communication channel that is not monitored or controlled by the target system's security measures. This can be achieved through various means like [DNS]() queries, [HTTP Protocol|HTTP]() requests to an external server, or other protocols that can bypass [Firewall|firewalls]() and [Intrusion Detection Systems|intrusion detection systems]().

Once the covert channel is set up, sensitive data from the target system is transmitted over this channel. The data could include anything from system files, confidential documents, user credentials, to database records. The attacker receives the exfiltrated data through the covert channel at an external location or server under their control.

- **DNS-Based Exfiltration**: Data is encoded into DNS queries and sent to a DNS server controlled by the attacker. Each query carries a small part of the stolen data.
- **HTTP-Based Exfiltration**: Data is transmitted to an external server by initiating HTTP requests (for example, through web beacons or similar methods) to a server controlled by the attacker.
- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Techniques like Out-of-Band [SQL Injection]() or [XML External Entities (XXE)|XXE (XML External Entity)]() vulnerabilities can be used to initiate the exfiltration process.

Out-of-Band Data Exfiltration can circumvent traditional security measures like firewalls, as it often uses allowed protocols and appears as legitimate traffic. This method of data exfiltration can be challenging to detect and requires advanced security solutions like anomaly detection, DNS monitoring, and egress filtering.
