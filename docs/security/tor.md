The Tor network, short for "The Onion Router," is a free and open-source software that enables anonymous communication on the internet. It is designed to protect the privacy and security of its users. 

Tor's primary purpose is to conceal its users' identities and their online activity from surveillance and traffic analysis. This is achieved by routing internet traffic through a worldwide, volunteer-run network of relays.

The name "Onion Router" comes from the method Tor uses to encrypt data multiple times, like layers of an onion. Each relay in the network peels away a single layer of encryption, uncovering the data's next destination, but unable to see the original message or its final destination.

When you use Tor, your data passes through a random sequence of relays. Each relay knows only the previous and next relay in the sequence, making it extremely difficult to trace the entire path of any piece of data.

Tor allows users to bypass internet censorship, access websites that are blocked in their country, and browse the internet without revealing their [IP address]().

Tor is known for facilitating access to the "dark web," a part of the internet not indexed by traditional search engines. It hosts a range of services, from the illicit to the privacy-conscious.

While often associated with illegal activities due to its anonymity features, Tor is also used by journalists, whistleblowers, law enforcement officers, and people living under repressive regimes to protect their identity online.

Due to the rerouting process, browsing speeds on Tor can be slower compared to a standard internet connection. Using Tor is legal in most countries. However, because of its association with the dark web and illegal activities, some countries may monitor or block its use.
