"Brute XSS" is an open-source tool specifically designed for identifying and testing for [[Cross-Site Scripting]] (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. 

XSS vulnerabilities are a common security issue where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into content that other users see. Brute XSS assists in automating the process of detecting these vulnerabilities.

Brute XSS automates the process of sending various payloads (malicious scripts) to target web applications to test for XSS vulnerabilities. The tool often allows for customization of payloads, enabling users to adapt their testing to different types of web applications and scenarios.

It can be used to test for XSS in various parts of a web application, such as form fields, URL parameters, headers, etc.
