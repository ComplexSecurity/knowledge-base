A pixel flood attack, more commonly known as a "pixel stuffing" or "image flood" attack, is a type of cyber attack that targets web advertising systems. This attack method involves stuffing additional, often invisible, pixels (small units of a digital image) with various tracking codes or ad tags into a single ad impression. It's a fraudulent technique used primarily in digital advertising for the purpose of generating false impressions and skewing advertising metrics. 

In a pixel flood attack, a large number of tracking pixels or ad tags are embedded into a web page, often hidden from the user. Each pixel represents a different ad impression, so when the page is loaded, it appears as if multiple ads have been viewed, even though they might be invisible to the actual visitor.

The pixels used in these attacks are typically tiny (1x1 pixels) and transparent, making them invisible to website visitors.

This method creates false ad impressions, misleading advertisers into thinking their ads are being viewed more frequently than they actually are. This can result in inflated charges for advertisers and unjustified revenues for the entities executing the attack.

Pixel flood attacks undermine the integrity of digital advertising metrics, leading to financial losses for advertisers. They distort key performance indicators like impressions, click-through rates, and conversion rate.

Detecting pixel stuffing can be challenging due to the stealthy nature of the attack. The invisible pixels do not affect the userâ€™s experience, making the attack less noticeable.

Ad networks and publishers implement various measures to detect and prevent pixel flooding, such as analyzing the behavior of ad requests, monitoring the number of pixels on a page, and employing ad fraud detection tools.

Pixel flood attacks are often associated with click fraud, another form of ad fraud where false clicks on ads are generated to inflate advertising costs or deplete competitors' advertising budgets.
