Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a server-side template, leading to the execution of unintended commands or code on the server. This vulnerability exploits web applications that use templating engines to dynamically generate [[HTML]] pages.

Template engines are used in web development to separate HTML structure from business logic. They allow server-side variables and expressions to be embedded in HTML, which the server then processes to generate the final HTML page. Examples include [[Jinja2]] for [[Python]], [[ERB]] for [[Ruby]], and [[Smarty]] for [[PHP]].

SSTI vulnerabilities arise when user input is improperly [[Input Sanitization|sanitized]] before being included in a template. This allows attackers to inject malicious template code, which the server then executes. The impact depends on the template engine and the serverâ€™s configuration.

In severe cases, SSTI can lead to [[Knowledge Base/Remote Code Execution|arbitrary code execution]] on the server. SSTI can be used to access sensitive data stored on the server, such as database credentials. Malicious template injections could cause server crashes or significant performance degradation.

A web application uses user input to construct a response using a template engine. If the input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject template directives, leading to unintended code execution.

For instance, in a Python application using Jinja2, injecting `{{ 7*'7' }}` would cause the server to evaluate and execute it, rendering `7777777`.
