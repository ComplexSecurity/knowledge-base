Process manipulation in the context of cybersecurity and computer programming refers to the techniques used to modify or interact with the operational state of a process running on a computer. This can involve changing the behavior of the process, extracting information from it, or using it to execute arbitrary code. Process manipulation is a common tactic in both legitimate applications and in malicious activities, such as malware execution and cybersecurity attacks

Some key aspects include:

1. Memory Manipulation: Modifying the memory space of a process. This can include injecting code or data into a process's memory, which is commonly seen in buffer overflow attacks or DLL injection techniques.
2. Process Injection: Inserting code into a running process. This is often done to execute malicious code in the context of a legitimate process, thereby bypassing security measures.
3. [Privilege Escalation](): Exploiting a process that runs with higher privileges to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted. This is a critical step in many cyber attacks to gain broader access to a system.
4. Process Hijacking: Taking control of a running process, often done by altering the process's execution flow, to perform unauthorized actions.
5. Debugging and Reverse Engineering: Attaching a debugger to a process to analyze or alter its runtime behavior. This is common in software development and reverse engineering but can also be used for malicious purposes.

In terms of hacking and penetration testing:

- **Exploiting Vulnerable Processes**: Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in processes to gain unauthorized access or control. Example: Buffer overflow attacks that manipulate the stack of a vulnerable process.
- **Malware Execution**: Using process manipulation techniques to execute malware in the context of a legitimate process to evade detection by antivirus software.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Manipulating processes to access sensitive information that they process or store in memory.
- **Maintaining Access**: Injecting code into system processes to maintain persistent access to a compromised system.
