Privilege escalation is a process in cybersecurity whereby an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a system or application to gain access to resources that are normally restricted from end-users or applications. This allows the attacker to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected, and thus enables them to perform unauthorized actions.

1. **Vertical Privilege Escalation**: This occurs when a lower-privileged user or process gains higher-level privileges, typically those of an administrative user or system account. For example, a regular user exploiting a vulnerability to gain administrator rights.
2. **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: This involves extending a user's abilities beyond those intended, but not necessarily gaining higher-level privileges. For example, a user accessing data or functions belonging to another user at the same privilege level.

Privilege escalation can occur through various means, including:

- Exploiting System Vulnerabilities: Taking advantage of security flaws or bugs in the operating system, applications, or services to gain unauthorized access or privileges.
- Misconfigured Permissions: Taking advantage of improperly configured permissions on files, directories, or network shares.
- [[Password Cracking]] and Credential Theft: Using stolen login credentials to access restricted areas of the system.
- [[Social Engineering]] Attacks: Tricking legitimate users into revealing their credentials or performing actions that elevate the attacker's access.

Privilege escalation is often a critical step in successful cyberattacks, allowing attackers to install persistent threats, access sensitive data, or take control of the system. Defending against privilege escalation involves regular patching of software, strict control and auditing of user permissions, and monitoring for suspicious activities that might indicate an attempt to gain unauthorized access.
