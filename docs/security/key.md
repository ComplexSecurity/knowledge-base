Keylogging, also known as keystroke logging, is a type of surveillance technology used to record the keystrokes made on a keyboard. This can be done through hardware or software. Keyloggers are often associated with malicious activities but can also be used for legitimate purposes.

There are 2 types of keyloggers:

1. **Software Keyloggers**: These are programs installed on a computer system that record keystrokes. They can capture all types of keyboard input, including passwords, messages, and other sensitive information.
2. **Hardware Keyloggers**: These are physical devices plugged into a computer, typically between the keyboard and the computer. They can be less detectable by software security measures.

Criminals use keyloggers to steal personal information, login credentials, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. They are also used for spying on individuals or organizations to gain unauthorized access to confidential information.
