rockyou.txt is a well-known [[wordlist]] file used in password cracking and penetration testing. It originated from a security breach in 2009, where a hacker attacked the social application website RockYou and exposed over 32 million user passwords. These passwords, which were stored in plain text, were then compiled into a wordlist file named rockyou.txt.

The file contains millions of passwords collected from the breach. These passwords range from very simple and commonly used to more complex and unique ones. Because it's derived from real-world user passwords, `rockyou.txt` is particularly effective in [[dictionary attacks]] and [[Brute Force Attack|brute-force attacks]], where common passwords or phrases are used to attempt to gain unauthorized access.
