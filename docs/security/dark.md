The dark web refers to a part of the internet that is not indexed by standard search engines and is accessible only through special software, such as [[Tor]] or I2P, which anonymize user traffic. It's known for hosting a range of anonymous and often illicit activities due to its ability to preserve user anonymity.

The dark web forms a small part of the [[Deep Web|deep web]], which includes all parts of the internet not indexed by search engines.

The dark web is a known hub for cybercriminal activities, including the sale of exploited data, hacking tools, and services. Understanding the nature of these threats can inform security strategies in penetration testing.

Cybercriminals often trade information about vulnerabilities, exploits, and hacking tools on the dark web. Penetration testers need to be aware of the latest exploits and vulnerabilities that might be in circulation. Sometimes, data from breaches (including credentials) ends up on the dark web. Penetration testers can use this information to understand common security weaknesses and trends in cyber attacks.

While penetration testers may access the dark web for research and staying informed on cybersecurity trends, any activity must be ethical and legal. Engaging in or endorsing illegal activities, even in the name of research, is not just unethical but could have legal repercussions.

For some security professionals, the dark web can be a source of threat intelligence. By monitoring dark web forums and marketplaces, they can gather insights about potential threats and targets.
