Data exfiltration, in the context of penetration testing and cybersecurity, refers to the unauthorized transfer of sensitive data from a target system or network to an external location controlled by an attacker. This is a critical phase in many cyber attacks, as the ultimate goal often involves accessing and removing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information from the compromised system.

Some methods include:

1. **Physical Media**: Using USB drives or other physical media to copy and remove data from a compromised system.
2. **Email**: Sending sensitive data to an external email address, either manually or through automated scripts.
3. **File Transfer Protocols**: Utilizing [File Transfer Protocol|FTP](), [Secure File Transfer Protocol|SFTP](), or similar protocols to transfer files from the target system to an attacker-controlled server.
4. **Cloud Storage Services**: Uploading stolen data to cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.
5. **Covert Channels**: Creating covert channels, such as steganography (hiding data within other files like images or videos), or tunneling data through other protocols (e.g., [DNS Tunneling]()) to avoid detection.
6. **Web Services**: Using [HTTP Protocol|HTTP]() or [HTTPS Protocol|HTTPS]() to post data to external websites or attacker-controlled web servers.
7. **Social Media Platforms**: Leveraging social media platforms to transmit data, as these platforms are often allowed through network [Firewall|firewalls]().
8. **Automated Exfiltration Tools**: Using specialized malware or scripts that automate the process of searching for, copying, and transmitting sensitive data.
9. **Encrypted Channels**: Encrypting the data before exfiltration to prevent detection by network security systems that inspect outbound data.
