Regex, short for Regular Expression, is a powerful tool used in programming for pattern matching within strings. It's a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern, which can be used for string searching and manipulation operations such as searching, replacing, and splitting text in most programming languages and command-line utilities.

Regex allows you to specify complex patterns of text to search for, such as specific characters, groups of characters, or even dynamic patterns that change within a certain context. It can match various text patterns through a combination of literal characters, wildcards, and special characters.

Regex is often the most efficient way to perform complex text processing, like extracting email addresses from a block of text or validating the format of input data.

A simple regex for an email could look like:

```bash
^\w+@\w+\.\w+$
```

Where:

- ^ - asserts the start of a line
- \\w+ - matches one or more word characters
- \@ - is a literal character that matches itself
- \\. - matches a period (a literal do)
- \$ - asserts the end of a line

During reconnaissance, regex can help in extracting information like email addresses, IP addresses, and URLs from large datasets or scraped web content. Regex helps in modifying attack payloads to evade detection by [[Intrusion Detection Systems|IDS]], which often rely on pattern matching to identify malicious traffic.

Regex can be used to generate complex fuzzing patterns to test applications for unexpected or insecure behavior when receiving malformed or unexpected inputs.

Regex is utilized in testing for [[Cross-Site Scripting|XSS]] and [[SQL Injection]] vulnerabilities to identify patterns that a malicious actor could exploit.

Regex is a powerful tool in the arsenal of a penetration tester or a web application hacker, used for efficiently searching, extracting, and manipulating text data. It enables precise targeting and analysis, making it invaluable in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. However, it requires a good understanding of regex syntax and patterns to be effectively used in these contexts.
