Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an [[APIs|API]] provided by [[Java]] that defines how a client may access a database. It provides methods for querying and updating data in a database and is oriented towards [[Relational Database|relational databases]]. JDBC plays a crucial role in Java applications that need to interact with databases for storing and retrieving data.

JDBC allows Java applications to interact with relational databases by sending [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] queries and receiving results. It's a key technology in Java for database operations. JDBC uses JDBC drivers to connect with database servers. These drivers are typically provided by database vendors and are specific to a database. The JDBC DriverManager class manages these drivers.

The `Connection` interface in JDBC is used for establishing a connection with the database. It includes methods for handling transactions like `commit`, `rollback`, and closing the connection. JDBC provides interfaces for creating and executing SQL statements. `Statement` is used for simple SQL queries, `PreparedStatement` for precompiled SQL queries, and `CallableStatement` for stored procedures.

The `ResultSet` interface represents the result set of a query. It's used to navigate and read the data returned by a query. JDBC supports batch processing of SQL commands and transaction management to ensure data integrity.

JDBC supports various data types used in SQL, mapping these to Java data types. JDBC provides a database-independent connectivity platform. This means the same code can generally be used with different databases with minimal changes, typically only changing the driver and connection details.

Some frameworks and libraries extend JDBC functionality, simplifying database interaction and providing features like connection pooling, better transaction management, and data access abstractions.

JDBC is widely used in enterprise applications, web applications, and standalone Java applications where interaction with relational databases is required.
