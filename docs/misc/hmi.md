Human-Machine Interface (HMI) refers to a user interface or dashboard that connects a person to a machine, system, or device. In industrial contexts, HMIs are crucial for interacting with and controlling complex machinery and processes in manufacturing plants, utility systems, and other industrial environments. They provide a graphical overview of the operational processes and allow operators to control and monitor these processes.

Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) are integral components of various [[industrial control systems (ICS)]], including [[Distributed Control Systems (DCS)]], [[Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC)|Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)]], [[Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)]], and [[Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)]] systems. HMIs serve as the primary interface between human operators and these complex control systems. 

HMIs typically include a graphical display that shows real-time data, system statuses, and control options. This interface can range from basic text and numeric readouts to complex graphical representations of the system.

HMIs allow operators to control the machinery or process system directly. This might include starting or stopping processes, adjusting settings, or manually overriding automatic controls. They often provide visualizations of the operational process, such as charts, graphs, and schematics, helping operators understand complex processes at a glance. 

HMIs can display alarms and notifications about system status, operational issues, or safety warnings, prompting timely human intervention when necessary. Modern HMIs are designed for ease of use, often featuring touch screens, intuitive interfaces, and customization options to suit different user preferences and requirements.

In [[Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)|SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)]] systems, the HMI is the central component through which operators interact with the system, monitoring processes and making adjustments as needed.

The effectiveness of an HMI greatly depends on its design and how well it meets the needs of its users. A well-designed HMI improves operational efficiency, reduces errors, and enhances safety. With the increasing connectivity of HMIs, especially in critical infrastructure, security is a major concern. HMIs need to be protected against unauthorized access and cyber threats.
