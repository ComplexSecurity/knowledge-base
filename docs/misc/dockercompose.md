Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container [[Docker]] applications. With Compose, you use a [[YAML]] file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes, and then create and start all the services from your configuration with a single command. It's a part of Docker, which is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight containers.

Docker Compose allows you to define your multi-container Docker application's configuration in a `docker-compose.yml` file, which makes the configuration easy to read, write, and maintain. It simplifies the setup of development environments where an application might require multiple services to run, such as a web server, a database, and a cache. All these services can be defined and run with a single command.

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, you define a set of services, networks, and volumes. A service is a container based on a Docker image, and it defines how that container should run (what ports to use, what volumes to mount, etc.).

Docker Compose provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing the lifecycle of your application. Common commands include `docker-compose up` to start the application, `docker-compose down` to stop it, and `docker-compose restart` to restart all services.

Compose sets up a network for your containers to communicate with each other and with the host machine. You can manage persistent data for your containers by defining volumes in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Compose supports the use of environment variables for configuring services, which is particularly useful for not exposing sensitive data. Compose works well with other Docker tools and services, providing a smooth workflow for developing, testing, and deploying applications.
