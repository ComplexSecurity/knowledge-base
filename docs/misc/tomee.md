Apache TomEE (pronounced "Tommy") is an open-source [[Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)]] application server that combines the simplicity of Tomcat with the capabilities of Java EE. It is part of the [[Apache Tomcat]] project and aims to provide a lightweight, yet fully compliant, Java EE container.

TomEE is designed to be a certified and compatible Java EE server. It implements the Java EE specifications, allowing developers to deploy enterprise applications that adhere to Java EE standards. 

TomEE is built on top of the Apache Tomcat servlet container. It extends Tomcat to provide support for Java EE features, such as [[Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs)|EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans)]], [[Java Persistence API (JPA)|JPA (Java Persistence API)]], [[JMS|JMS (Java Message Service)]], and more.

Similar to Tomcat, TomEE is known for its lightweight nature and ease of embedding. It is suitable for both development and production environments where a minimalistic and resource-efficient server is desired. TomEE supports different profiles that cater to different needs. These profiles include TomEE Web Profile, TomEE [[JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services)|JAX-RS]] (RESTful services), TomEE Plus (full profile with additional features), and more. Users can choose the profile that best fits their application requirements.

TomEE includes support for [[CDI]], which is a powerful dependency injection framework in Java EE. CDI simplifies the development of enterprise applications by providing a standard way to manage beans and their dependencies.

TomEE supports various enterprise features, including transaction management, security, messaging, and more. It allows developers to build robust and scalable enterprise applications. TomEE is part of the Apache Software Foundation and integrates well with other Apache projects. For example, it can be used in conjunction with [[Apache ActiveMQ]] for messaging and Apache OpenJPA for persistence.

Apache TomEE is developed and maintained by a community of contributors. It benefits from the collaborative efforts of developers who work on enhancing its features, fixing bugs, and ensuring compatibility with the latest Java EE specifications.
