Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data over short distances from fixed and mobile devices. It creates [[Personal Area Networks (PANs)]] with high levels of security. 

Bluetooth is designed for short-range communication, typically up to about 30 feet (10 meters), although newer versions can reach over 100 meters in ideal conditions. One of the defining features of Bluetooth is its low power consumption, making it ideal for mobile and battery-powered devices.

It allows for the connection of multiple devices, enabling them to communicate wirelessly. This includes connecting peripherals like headsets, speakers, keyboards, and mice to computers or smartphones.

There have been several versions of Bluetooth, each improving on speed, range, and energy efficiency. Newer devices are generally backward compatible with older Bluetooth versions.

Bluetooth uses a variety of protocols and profiles to ensure that different types of devices can connect and communicate effectively. For example, the Headset Profile (HSP) for telephone headsets and the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) for sending stereo audio.

Bluetooth includes security features such as encryption and authentication, which help to protect data as it is transferred between devices. Its applications are varied and include file transfer, audio streaming, real-time location systems, health monitoring, and connecting smart home devices.

[[Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)]]  is a power-conserving variant of Bluetooth, used in applications that do not require continuous data streaming, such as fitness trackers and smart home devices and [[IoT]] devices.
