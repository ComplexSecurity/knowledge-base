WildFly is an open-source, lightweight, and modular [[Java]]-based application server. It is developed by the JBoss community, now part of Red Hat. WildFly is designed to be fast, lightweight, and feature-rich, making it suitable for a wide range of enterprise applications.

WildFly is fully compatible with the [[Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)|Java EE]] and [[Jakarta EE]] specifications, providing a runtime environment for enterprise Java applications. It is known for its fast startup times and low memory footprint, making it suitable for microservices architectures and cloud-native applications.

WildFly adopts a modular architecture based on the [[JBoss Modular Service Container (MSC)]]. This allows for better modularity, reducing the overhead of unnecessary components. WildFly supports a wide range of Java EE and Jakarta EE standards, including [[Java Servlets|Servlets]], [[JSP|JSP]], [[CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)]], [[Java Persistence API (JPA)|JPA (Java Persistence API)]], and more. It also supports MicroProfile, a set of microservices specifications.

WildFly can be used in embedded mode, allowing developers to embed it within their applications for testing and development purposes. WildFly provides features for clustering and high availability, enabling the deployment of applications in a distributed and scalable manner.

WildFly includes a web-based management console that allows administrators to configure and monitor the server easily. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing deployments, data sources, and other server configurations. WildFly includes robust security features, including support for various authentication mechanisms, role-based access control, and encryption.

WildFly has an active and vibrant community of developers and users. It benefits from ongoing contributions and support from the open-source community.
