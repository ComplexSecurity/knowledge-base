Hyper-V Manager is a management tool provided by Microsoft that allows administrators and users to create, manage, and operate [[virtual machines]] (VMs) on a [[Hyper-V]] host. It is a part of the Hyper-V role in Windows Server, and it's also available on Windows 10 and Windows 11 for desktop virtualization. Hyper-V Manager provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with and manage Hyper-V environments.

Hyper-V Manager enables the creation, configuration, and management of virtual machines. Users can set up various aspects of a VM, such as the amount of memory, number of processors, and storage options.

It allows for the configuration and management of virtual networks that VMs can use to communicate with each other and with the outside network. Hyper-V Manager provides the capability to take snapshots (known as checkpoints in later versions) of VMs, allowing users to save the current state of a VM and revert back to it if needed.

It offers basic performance monitoring tools to track the resource usage of VMs, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network statistics. Users can import and export VMs, which is useful for moving VMs between different hosts or for backup and recovery purposes. It allows the addition of virtual hardware to VMs, like network adapters and virtual disks.

Running Hyper-V requires a 64-bit processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), VM Monitor Mode extensions, and hardware-assisted virtualization. For more complex or large-scale virtualization environments, Microsoft also offers [[System Center Virtual Machine Manager]] (SCVMM), which provides more advanced features.
