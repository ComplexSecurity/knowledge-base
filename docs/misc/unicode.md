Unicode is a comprehensive character encoding system designed to represent text for all the writing systems of the world, both modern and ancient. It goes far beyond the capabilities of earlier encoding systems like [[ASCII]].

Unicode aims to include every character from every written language, along with technical symbols, mathematical symbols, and even emojis. This universal approach allows for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text in many languages and scripts.

In Unicode, each character is assigned a unique code point, a number that identifies that character. Unicode defines more than a million code points, spread across 17 planes (each plane has 65,536 code points). These code points are typically represented in the format U+XXXX, where "XXXX" is a hexadecimal number.
