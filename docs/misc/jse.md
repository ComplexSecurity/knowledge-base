Java SE (Standard Edition) is a computing platform for development and deployment of portable code for desktop and server environments. It forms the core foundation for the [[Java]] programming language and is used for a wide range of computing tasks, from small-scale applications on desktops to large-scale enterprise solutions.

Java SE provides the basic components needed to develop and run Java applications. It includes the [[Java Runtime Environment (JRE)]], a set of libraries, the [[Java Virtual Machine (JVM)]], and other components necessary for Java application development. The JVM is a crucial part of Java SE, allowing Java programs to run on any platform without the need for recompilation, hence the famous slogan “Write Once, Run Anywhere.”

Java SE includes a comprehensive set of standard libraries ([[APIs]]) that provide functionality for various tasks such as I/O operations, networking, data structures, graphical user interface (GUI) development, and much more.

It supports all the features of the Java language, including object-oriented programming, threads, lambda expressions (as of Java 8), and generics. Java SE comes with tools for developing and debugging Java applications, including the `javac` compiler, the `java` launcher, and other utilities.

Through libraries such as AWT, Swing, and JavaFX, Java SE allows for the development of graphical desktop applications. While [[Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)|Java EE (Enterprise Edition)]] is specifically tailored for web and enterprise applications, Java SE also includes capabilities for developing server-side applications.

Java SE provides strong security features, including a security manager, cryptographic libraries, and tools for securing Java applications. Applications written in Java SE are portable across many operating systems and platforms, maintaining compatibility across different Java SE versions.

Java SE benefits from a large ecosystem and community, contributing to a vast array of libraries, frameworks, tools, and resources available for Java developers.
