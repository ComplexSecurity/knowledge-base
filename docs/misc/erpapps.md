SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications are integrated software solutions developed by SAP SE, designed to manage and streamline core business processes across various departments within an organization.

These ERP applications play a crucial role in helping organizations maintain efficiency and competitiveness by providing real-time data and tools to manage operations.

SAP ERP applications consist of several modules, each focused on different business areas. Notable modules include:

SAP ERP systems are known for their ability to process data in real-time, enabling timely decision-making and responsiveness to changing business conditions. SAP ERP can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or through a hybrid model, offering flexibility depending on the organization's requirements.
