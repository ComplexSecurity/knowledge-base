Shopify is an ecommerce platform you can use to build an online store. It allows you to sell both online with your own website and/or in person using a point-of-sale app. Shopify is easy for everyone to use, from beginner dropshippers to high-growth D2C brands. 

Shopify works by unifying your online and retail sales on a single platform. With Shopify, you can bridge functions like inventory, marketing, payments, and shipping. This enables you to streamline your business and integrate any tools you need.

Shopify is cloud-based software, meaning you can access it from any internet-enabled device. Plus, it’s a fully hosted ecommerce solution, which means Shopify merchants do not have to worry about hosting their own website.
