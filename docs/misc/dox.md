Doxygen is a documentation generator, a tool used for writing software documentation from annotated source code. It is one of the most popular tools of its kind and is particularly prevalent in [[C++]], [[C]], and [[CSharp|C#]] development, although it supports other programming languages like [[Java]], [[Objective-C]], [[Python]], [[PHP]], and more.

Doxygen extracts documentation from source code comments. The comments are often written in a structured format that Doxygen understands, allowing it to generate well-formatted and organized documentation. While primarily used for C-like languages, Doxygen also supports other languages, making it versatile for multi-language projects.

Doxygen can produce documentation in several formats, including [[HTML]], [[LaTeX]] (for printable PDFs), man pages, [[RTF]], and [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]]. It can generate class diagrams, inheritance diagrams, collaboration diagrams, and call graphs using Graphviz software.

Doxygen provides functionalities to create cross-references in the documentation, making navigation easier. It can be configured to work with version control systems, ensuring that the documentation is always in sync with the source code.

In a C++ project, a developer might annotate a class like this:

```cpp
/**
 * @brief A brief description of the MyClass class.
 *
 * Detailed description of MyClass.
 */
class MyClass {
public:
    /**
     * @brief A brief description of the myMethod method.
     * @param param1 Description of the first parameter.
     * @return Description of the return value.
     */
    int myMethod(int param1);
};
```

Doxygen would process these comments to generate comprehensive documentation for the `MyClass` class and its `myMethod` method, including descriptions of the method's purpose, its parameters, and its return value.

Doxygen is typically run from the command line, where it reads a configuration file (Doxyfile) that specifies how the documentation should be generated. Users can customize a wide range of settings in the Doxyfile to tailor the output to their specific needs.
