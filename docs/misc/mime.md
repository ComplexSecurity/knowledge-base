MIME-Type, short for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions Type, is a standard that indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes. It is used to specify the type of content that a file contains, which helps web browsers and other software to handle the file appropriately.

MIME-Types are used to identify the format of files transmitted over the Internet (via email, web browsers, etc.) so that applications know how to process them. For example, when a web server sends a document, it also sends the MIME-Type in the [[HTTP Headers|HTTP header]] to inform the client about the type of data being sent.

A MIME-Type is generally structured as a type and a subtype, separated by a slash. For example, `text/html` for [[HTML]] files, `image/jpeg` for JPEG images, and `application/json` for [[JavaScript Object Notation|JSON]] files.

Common Types:
- **Text**: Used for text-based files, like `text/plain`, `text/html`, `text/css`, `text/javascript`.
- **Image**: Used for image files, like `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`.
- **Application**: Used for various kinds of binary data and special files, like `application/json`, `application/xml`, `application/zip`, `application/pdf`.

In web development, correctly setting the MIME-Type of content being sent to the browser is crucial for its correct rendering or processing. For instance, [[CSS]] files should be `text/css`, and ][[JavaScript]] files should be `text/javascript` or `application/javascript`.

Incorrect or misleading MIME-Types can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, if an executable file is served with an innocuous MIME-Type (like `text/plain`), it might bypass security checks.

MIME-Types are also used in content negotiation, where the client and server exchange information about which formats they can understand and use. In emails, MIME-Types are used to indicate the type of attached files, ensuring the email client handles the attachments correctly.

Browsers often use the MIME-Type, along with file extensions, to determine how to process a document. For example, they can render, download, or ask the user how to handle different types of files based on their MIME-Types.
