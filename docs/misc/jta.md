The Java Transaction API (JTA) is a [[Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)]] API that allows applications to perform distributed transactions, which means transactions that span multiple resources like databases and messaging systems. JTA is part of the Java EE platform and is used for managing transactions in a consistent and reliable way across various data sources in an enterprise environment.

JTA enables applications to handle distributed transactions, where a single transaction might involve multiple operations across various data sources, and all these operations need to be treated as a single unit of work.

JTA transactions ensure [[ACID]] (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. This means that all operations within a transaction are treated as a single atomic unit, which either completely succeed or completely fail.

JTA typically uses a two-phase commit protocol to ensure all resources either commit or roll back changes in a coordinated manner. This is essential for maintaining data consistency across different systems.

Key interfaces in JTA include `UserTransaction`, which is used for demarcating transaction boundaries, and `TransactionManager`, which is responsible for managing transactions across multiple resources. JTA is often used with other Java EE components like [[Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs)]], [[Java Persistence API (JPA)]], and Java Message Service ([[JMS]]) to provide transactional support.

Java EE application servers (like WildFly, IBM WebSphere, and Oracle WebLogic) provide support for JTA, allowing applications deployed on these servers to participate in transactions managed by JTA.

JTA supports both declarative transaction management (using annotations or [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] configuration) and programmatic transaction management (explicitly coding transaction boundaries). JTA is based on the X/Open XA standard for distributed transaction processing, which allows it to work with various XA-compliant resources, like relational databases and message-oriented middleware.

JTA provides a unified and standardized way to handle complex transactions in enterprise applications, ensuring data integrity and consistency across different systems. JTA is particularly suitable for large-scale, enterprise-level applications where transactions involve multiple databases or other transactional resources.
