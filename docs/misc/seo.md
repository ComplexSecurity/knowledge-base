SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It's the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to a website through organic search engine results. The goal of SEO is to improve a site's visibility in the unpaid (organic) section of search engine results, making it more likely for the site to be visited by users.

Some key elements include:

1. **Keywords**: Identifying and using relevant keywords that users are searching for. These keywords should be integrated into the website's content.
2. **Content Quality**: Creating high-quality, useful, and informative content that meets the needs of searchers. This includes articles, videos, and other forms of media.
3. **User Experience (UX)**: Designing a website that's easy to navigate and engaging for users.
4. **Site Speed and Performance**: Ensuring the website loads quickly and performs well on different devices and browsers.
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimizing the site for mobile devices, considering more users are browsing on smartphones and tablets.
6. **Backlinks**: Acquiring high-quality links from other reputable websites.
7. **Social Signals**: The presence and engagement on social media platforms can indirectly influence SEO.
8. **Local SEO**: For businesses serving specific geographical areas, optimizing for local search is crucial.

As an example, consider a local bakery that wants to attract more customers through its website. The bakery implements SEO by:

- Researching keywords that potential customers might use, like “freshly baked bread in \[City Name]” or “best chocolate cake near me”.
- Updating its website with high-quality content, such as blog posts about different types of bread, recipes, and the benefits of fresh bakery items.
- Ensuring the website loads quickly and is easy to navigate.
- Creating a Google My Business profile to appear in local searches and maps.
- Encouraging satisfied customers to leave positive reviews on various online platforms.

SEO intersects with cybersecurity in several ways:

1. **SEO Spam & Malware**: Hackers might inject malicious content or links into a website (often through outdated plugins/themes or weak passwords). This practice, known as SEO spam, can harm the site’s ranking and reputation.
2. **Phishing and Scam Sites**: Cybercriminals create websites optimized for SEO to appear legitimate and rank high in search results. They use these sites to conduct [[phishing]] attacks or scams.
3. **Negative SEO Attacks**: Competitors or malicious actors might use SEO techniques to harm a site's ranking, like creating toxic backlinks or duplicating content.
4. **Search Engine Poisoning**: Attackers manipulate SEO to promote malicious websites in search results, often to distribute malware or conduct phishing.
