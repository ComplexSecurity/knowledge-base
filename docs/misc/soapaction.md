`SOAPAction` is a header in the [[SOAP|Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)]] used in web services. SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It uses [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] to format its messages, relies on application layer protocols, typically [[HTTP Protocol|HTTP]] or [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], for message negotiation and transmission, and offers a way to communicate between applications running on different operating systems.

The `SOAPAction` HTTP header field is used to indicate the intent of the SOAP HTTP request. It is a mechanism to express the specific action to be performed by the SOAP message, often correlating to a particular operation or method in the web service.

The `SOAPAction` header is part of the HTTP headers in a SOAP message. It is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that identifies the intent of the SOAP message. The format typically looks like this:

```vbnet
SOAPAction: "http://example.com/soap/actionUri"
```

In SOAP-based web services, different operations provided by the service can be identified using the `SOAPAction` header. This helps the server to appropriately route the SOAP message to the correct service handler or operation. In SOAP 1.1, the `SOAPAction` header was mandatory, but in SOAP 1.2, it was made optional and its use is considered a best practice rather than a requirement. This change was due to the evolution of web services and the need for more flexibility in the way SOAP messages are processed.

While `SOAPAction` is useful for routing and processing SOAP messages, it should be noted that the reliance on [[HTTP headers]] can have security implications. It's important for services to properly validate and handle `SOAPAction` headers to prevent issues like [[SOAPAction Spoofing]] or injection attacks.

In a web service where multiple operations are available, the `SOAPAction` header can be used to distinguish which specific request or action the SOAP message is intended for, especially when multiple actions are available at the same endpoint URL. The `SOAPAction` header can also be important for interoperability purposes, ensuring that different software systems can effectively communicate and understand the purpose of each SOAP message.
