Apache ActiveMQ is an open-source message broker written in [[Java]]. It provides robust, scalable, and flexible messaging solutions. As a popular implementation of the [[Java Messaging Service (JMS)|Java Message Service (JMS)]] API, ActiveMQ facilitates the communication between different components of a distributed application by exchanging messages. It's widely used in enterprise systems for integrating various applications and services.

ActiveMQ is a fully JMS-compliant message broker, supporting JMS 1.1 and 2.0. This allows applications to create, send, receive, and read messages. Like other message brokers, ActiveMQ enables asynchronous communication, allowing different parts of a system to communicate with each other without needing to respond immediately.

It supports various messaging models, including point-to-point (queue-based) and publish-subscribe (topic-based) messaging. ActiveMQ can be integrated into numerous environments and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for enterprise application integration.

It provides connectors for various protocols and technologies beyond JMS, including [[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)|AMQP]], [[MQTT|MQTT]], [[STOMP|STOMP]], and [[WebSockets]], enhancing its interoperability. ActiveMQ is designed for high performance and scalability. It supports clustering and load balancing, making it suitable for high-load and failover scenarios.

Messages can be persisted to ensure they are not lost in case of broker failure, providing reliable message delivery. ActiveMQ includes features for securing message communication, including SSL/TLS support and the ability to integrate with various authentication and authorization mechanisms.
