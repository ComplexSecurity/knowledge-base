IBM DB2 is a family of data management products, including database servers, developed by IBM. It is known for its robust performance, scalability, and reliability, catering to various business needs.

DB2 primarily functions as a [[Relational Database Management System|relational DBMS]] with support for object-oriented features and non-relational structures like [[JavaScript Object Notation|JSON]] and [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]].

It's designed to operate on multiple platforms, including Linux, UNIX, and Windows, as well as IBM's mainframe systems. This cross-platform compatibility is a significant advantage for organizations with diverse IT environments.

DB2 is well-regarded for its high performance, particularly in large enterprise environments. It can handle massive volumes of data and high transaction rates, making it suitable for big data applications and high-performance computing.

DB2 includes features for data warehousing and analytics. It supports in-database analytics, allowing users to run complex queries and analytics operations directly on the database, which can significantly improve performance and reduce data movement.

It offers robust security features, including advanced encryption capabilities, access control mechanisms, and compliance tools to help organizations meet various regulatory requirements.

It offers compatibility with other [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] databases, providing tools and features to ease the migration process from other databases like [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] or [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]] to DB2.
