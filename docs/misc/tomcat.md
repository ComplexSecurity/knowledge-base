Apache Tomcat is a Java Servlet container, or web container, that provides the extended functionality to interact with Java Servlets, while also implementing several technical specifications of the Java platform: JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Expression Language (Java EL) and WebSocket.

A Java Servlet is software that enables a web server to handle dynamic Java-based web content using the [[HTTP protocol]]. JSP is a similar technology that allows developers to create dynamic content using [[HTML]] or [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] documents. 

In terms of their ability to enable dynamic content, Java Servlets and JSP are broadly comparable to [[PHP]] or [[ASP.NET]], just based on the Java programming language.

By bringing all these Java-based technologies together, Tomcat Apache offers a “pure Java” web server environment for running applications built on the Java programming language.
