WS-BPEL (Web Services Business Process Execution Language) is a standard for specifying business process behaviors based on [[Web Services]]. This [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]]-based language is used to define a business process model, which includes both the sequence of services to be invoked (the process flow) and the business logic that dictates the order of these service invocations.

WS-BPEL enables the automation of business processes by integrating a series of discrete services (often web services) into an end-to-end process flow.

This integration is crucial for enterprises that rely on diverse software systems, allowing them to orchestrate various services into coherent, automated business processes. BPEL is often used in [[Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)|SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)]] environments, where it helps in managing complex interactions among various web services.
