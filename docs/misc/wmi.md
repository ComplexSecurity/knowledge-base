Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a core component of the Microsoft Windows operating system that provides a standardized way to access and manage Windows-based systems both locally and remotely. WMI is Microsoft's implementation of the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) and Common Information Model (CIM) standards defined by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF).

WMI allows administrators and scripts to retrieve information about the status and configuration of computer systems and applications, including hardware details, operating system settings, network configuration, running services, and installed software. With WMI, administrators can perform operations on remote computers, making it an essential tool for managing large networks of Windows machines.

WMI can monitor and notify about specific system events, such as changes in system configuration, file modifications, or system errors, enabling automated responses to these events. WMI is accessible via scripting languages like [[Windows PowerShell]] and [[VBScript]], allowing for the automation of administrative tasks and the creation of custom management tools and applications.

WMI can be extended to include custom information and functions, providing flexibility to address specific management needs.

In the context of hacking and cybersecurity:

- **Attackers' Tool**: Malicious actors can use WMI for [[persistence]], [[lateral movement]], and execution of payloads. WMI scripts can be difficult to detect, making them a stealthy option for attackers.
- **Defense Strategies**: Monitoring WMI activity can be an important part of a security strategy. Unusual WMI requests may indicate a compromise.
- **Forensics and Incident Response**: WMI logs can provide valuable information during cybersecurity investigations.
