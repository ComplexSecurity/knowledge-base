The Java Community Process (JCP), established by Sun Microsystems in 1998, is the mechanism for developing standard technical specifications for [[Java]] technology. It is a formalized process that allows interested parties to contribute to the definition and evolution of Java specifications. 

The JCP involves the use of Java Specification Requests (JSRs) - the formal documents that describe proposed specifications and technologies to be added to the Java platform.

The JCP is open to anyone interested in Java development, including individual developers, organizations, and companies. Participants can contribute by reviewing and providing feedback on JSRs, or by becoming a JCP member to submit and lead JSRs.

A JSR is a formal document that describes a proposed specification or technology addition to the Java platform. Each JSR goes through several stages, including submission, review, and final approval or rejection. The process encourages community involvement and transparency, allowing the Java community to have a say in how the Java platform evolves.

Each JSR has an Expert Group (EG) responsible for its content. The EG includes members from various backgrounds like Java developers, architects, and engineers, contributing their expertise and insights. JSRs are subject to public review, allowing anyone in the community to provide feedback and suggestions. This feedback is considered crucial for the development of robust and widely-accepted specifications.

After passing through various review stages, a JSR goes to a Final Approval Ballot, where JCP members vote on whether to approve the JSR as a new standard or technology for Java. The JCP has been instrumental in the evolution of Java, ensuring that it remains a relevant and up-to-date technology. 

It has overseen numerous enhancements, including major releases of [[Java SE (Standard Edition)]], [[Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)|Java EE (Enterprise Edition)]], and [[Java ME (Micro Edition)]].
