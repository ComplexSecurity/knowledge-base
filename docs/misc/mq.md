IBM MQ, formerly known as [[IBM WebSphere]] MQ, is a robust and secure messaging middleware by IBM. It enables applications to communicate and exchange data in a reliable and scalable way, regardless of the environment (mainframe, enterprise, or cloud). 

IBM MQ is designed to facilitate the assured, secure, and efficient transfer of information between applications, systems, services, and files. Hereâ€™s an overview:

IBM MQ is a message-oriented middleware (MOM) solution. It uses message queues to facilitate the exchange of information between distributed application systems across various platforms. By using message queues, IBM MQ allows for temporal and spatial decoupling of application components, meaning that the sender and receiver of the message do not need to be available at the same time or be directly connected.

It enables asynchronous communication, where applications can put messages on a queue and not wait for a response to continue processing. IBM MQ ensures message delivery and integrity. Messages are not lost if a receiver, sender, or intermediary system is temporarily unavailable.

The platform supports transactions, enabling the grouping of several actions into a single unit of work that either completely succeeds or fails, ensuring consistency in message processing. It provides robust security features, including encryption and authentication, to protect sensitive data and ensure that messages are not tampered with during transit.

IBM MQ is highly scalable, capable of handling large volumes of messages and numerous concurrent applications. Used across multiple industries, including finance, healthcare, and retail, IBM MQ addresses complex messaging needs like banking transactions, inventory management, and order processing systems.

IBM MQ supports various messaging patterns, including point-to-point, publish/subscribe, and file transfer.
