A bug bounty program is an initiative offered by many websites, organizations, and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to security vulnerabilities and exploits.

The primary focus is often on identifying security vulnerabilities in a software or system. These vulnerabilities could include issues like [[cross-site scripting]], [[SQL injection]], [[buffer overflows]], and more. Those who report vulnerabilities are usually rewarded. The rewards can vary greatly depending on the severity of the bug and the company's policy. They might range from small tokens of appreciation or merchandise to significant monetary rewards for major discoveries.

Most bug bounty programs have specific guidelines. These guidelines define the scope of the program, what constitutes a valid bug, how to report it, and the rules of engagement to ensure ethical conduct (like not exploiting the bug for harm). Some companies run public bug bounty programs where anyone can participate, while others may have private programs, where participation is by invitation only.

These programs are beneficial for both the organization and the security community. They allow organizations to harness the skills of a wide range of individuals to help secure their systems, and they offer an ethical outlet for security researchers and hackers to apply their skills. There are platforms like HackerOne or Bugcrowd that host and manage bug bounty programs for various companies. These platforms provide a framework and process for submission, evaluation, and reward of bug findings.
