Logical operators are fundamental elements in programming and logic used to combine or modify Boolean expressions. A Boolean expression is one that evaluates to either true or false. Logical operators are used to perform logical operations, and they are essential for controlling the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions. 

The primary logical operators are:

- AND - operator returns true if both operands are true
- OR - returns true if at least one of the operands is true
- NOT - inverts the truth value of its operand
- NAND - combination of NOT and AND, returns false if both operands are true, otherwise true.
- NOR - combines NOT and OR, returns true only when all operands are false
- XOR - operators returns true if and only if exactly one of the operands is true

Logical operators in [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] are used to combine or modify conditions in a SQL statement, particularly within the WHERE clause, which filters records based on specified criteria. 

These operators are crucial for formulating complex queries, allowing you to refine and target your data retrieval effectively.
