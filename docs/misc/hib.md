Hibernate is an open-source [[Object-Relational Mapping|Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)]] tool for [[Java]]. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database, simplifying the development process by handling database interactions and abstracting the complexity of database operations.

As an ORM tool, Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and Java data types to [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] data types. This allows developers to work with objects in their Java code rather than dealing with SQL queries directly.

Hibernate simplifies [[CRUD API|CRUD]] (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as developers can perform these operations on objects without writing complex SQL queries. Hibernate provides its own query language known as [[HQL (Hibernate Query Language)]], which is object-oriented and similar to SQL. HQL allows writing database-independent queries, which Hibernate translates into SQL.

Hibernate comes with an internal caching mechanism that can be configured to improve application performance by reducing the number of queries made to the database. It offers a powerful transaction management system, simplifying complex transaction operations and ensuring data integrity.

Hibernate is database-independent. It can work with different databases like [[MySQL (KB)|MySQL]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[PostgreSQL]], and more, making it easier to switch databases if needed. Mapping entities to database tables can be done via annotations in the Java code or using [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] configuration files.

Hibernate supports lazy loading, meaning it fetches data only when it is needed, which can be a significant performance enhancement. It can be used in any Java environment, from standalone applications to [[Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)|Java EE]] frameworks like [[Spring Framework|Spring]].

Hibernate handles session management, providing an interface between the Java application and the database. With a large community of users and contributors, Hibernate is continually updated and maintained, and there's a wealth of resources and support available.
