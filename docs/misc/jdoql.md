JDOQL, or Java Data Objects Query Language, is the query language for [[JDO|Java Data Objects (JDO)]]. It is used for querying data stored in a database, but unlike [[Structured Query Language|SQL]], which operates on tables and columns, JDOQL works on Java classes and objects. 

JDOQL is a part of the JDO specification, which provides a standard way for [[Java]] developers to interact with various data stores using object persistence. JDOQL allows developers to write queries in a way that is consistent with Java's object-oriented paradigm. Queries are written against Java classes and their fields, not directly against database tables.

The syntax of JDOQL is similar to Java's expression syntax, which makes it familiar and easy to understand for Java developers. Since JDOQL operates at the object level, it aligns with JDO's principle of transparent persistence, allowing developers to focus on the object model rather than the underlying database schema.

JDOQL queries can filter and order data based on the persistent fields of a class. These fields are defined in the JDO metadata. JDOQL can navigate and query across collections and relationships defined in the object model. JDOQL supports parameterized queries, enhancing query flexibility and security by separating the query logic from the data values.

JDOQL queries are executed by JDO's PersistenceManager, which translates them into the query language of the underlying data store, whether itâ€™s a relational database or another type of data store. JDOQL is tightly integrated with the JDO API, allowing seamless interaction between querying and other persistence operations.

While similar in purpose to SQL, JDOQL is more object-oriented, focusing on Java classes and objects, which can make it more intuitive for Java developers but less directly related to the structure of the underlying database. JDOQL is particularly useful in applications where the data model is heavily object-oriented and there is a need to abstract away from the specifics of the underlying database system.
