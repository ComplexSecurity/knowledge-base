XStream is a simple [[Java]] library used for serializing Java objects to [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] and back again. It provides an easy and convenient way to convert objects to XML and to reconstruct them without the need for any additional mapping. XStream stands out for its simplicity and ease of use compared to more complex XML handling methods like [[JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding)|JAXB]] or [[SAX (Simple API for XML)|SAX]].

XStream allows for direct serialization of Java objects to XML and vice versa with minimal configuration. This simplicity makes it popular for scenarios where quick and straightforward XML handling is needed.

Unlike JAXB, XStream does not require the Java objects to be annotated with XML metadata. This can make it a good choice for cases where modifying the source code of the object classes is not feasible or desirable.

XStream provides [[XStream]] to customize the XML output. It allows for changing element names, attributes, and adding custom converters to handle specific types.

Its API is straightforward, often requiring only a few lines of code to serialize or deserialize objects, which makes it appealing for developers who need a quick solution without the complexity of other XML frameworks. XStream allows developers to define aliases for Java class names and field names, making the generated XML more readable and cleaner.

It does not require an XML schema (XSD) to work. Objects are serialized and deserialized based on their runtime structure. XStream includes mechanisms to prevent security vulnerabilities related to object serialization, such as restricting the classes that can be serialized or deserialized.

It is compatible with a wide range of Java versions and can be used in both Java SE and Java EE environments. XStream can be integrated with other libraries and frameworks, enhancing its functionality and adaptability. It is often used in applications that require quick and simple persistence of object graphs, configuration files, or in scenarios where XML is used for data interchange between systems.
