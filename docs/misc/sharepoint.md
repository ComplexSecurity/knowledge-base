SharePoint is a web-based collaboration and document management platform developed by Microsoft. It's part of the Microsoft Office suite of products but is also available as a standalone product. SharePoint is designed to facilitate collaboration, information sharing, and document management within organizations, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level content management and intranet portals.

SharePoint allows teams to create, store, and manage documents in a centralized location. It supports version control, document check-in/check-out, and sharing capabilities. Organizations use SharePoint to create internal portals where employees can access company news, announcements, shared resources, and collaborative tools.

SharePoint can automate business processes with built-in workflow capabilities, streamlining tasks like document approvals, custom business processes, and task assignments. It integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft Office products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, enhancing productivity and collaboration.

SharePoint can be customized to meet specific organizational needs. It supports custom development, allowing businesses to build tailored solutions on top of the SharePoint platform. It offers robust search features, making it easy to find documents, sites, and people within the organization.
