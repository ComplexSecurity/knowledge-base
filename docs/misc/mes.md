Microsoft Exchange Server is a mail server and calendaring server developed by Microsoft. It runs exclusively on Windows Server operating systems and is part of Microsoft's line of business server products. Exchange Server is widely used in businesses and organizations for its robust capabilities in email management, calendaring, tasks, and contacts.

Exchange Server provides a platform for hosting enterprise-level email services, complete with features like email storage, forwarding, and filtering. It includes advanced calendaring features, allowing users to schedule meetings, share calendars, and coordinate events.

Exchange Server includes integrated task management and contact management features, syncing this information across devices and users. It is designed to work seamlessly with Microsoft Outlook, a popular email client, providing a rich user interface for managing emails, calendars, contacts, and tasks.

Exchange supports mobile access, including native synchronization with smartphones and tablets, using Microsoft's [[ActiveSync|ActiveSync protocol]]. The server includes built-in protections against spam and malware, along with compliance tools for archiving, eDiscovery, and data loss prevention. 

Some versions of Exchange include Unified Messaging features, integrating voicemails and faxes with the email system. Part of [[Microsoft 365]] (formerly Office 365), Exchange Online offers cloud-based email and calendaring services, eliminating the need for on-premises servers.
