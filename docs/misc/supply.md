In the context of the [[Industrial IoT (IIoT)|Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)]], Supply Chain Management (SCM) refers to the use of advanced [[IoT]] technologies to enhance and streamline supply chain and logistics operations. IIoT brings a new dimension of connectivity, automation, and data-driven insights into supply chain management.

IIoT enables the real-time tracking of goods as they move through the supply chain. Smart sensors and [[Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)|RFID]] tags can provide live updates on the location, condition, and progress of products, from manufacturing to delivery.

By collecting and analyzing data from various points in the supply chain, IIoT facilitates predictive analytics. This can help in forecasting demand, managing inventory levels, and planning for transportation needs more effectively.

Smart inventory management systems can automatically monitor stock levels, reducing the chances of overstocking or stockouts. This ensures optimal inventory levels are maintained, improving efficiency.

IIoT devices can automate routine tasks, streamline operations, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. For instance, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in warehouses can optimize picking and placing processes.

Sensors can monitor the condition of goods, especially perishable products, in transit. Parameters like temperature, humidity, and vibration can be continually assessed to ensure product quality. Automation and advanced data capture techniques reduce human error, leading to more accurate order fulfillment and inventory records.

By optimizing various aspects of the supply chain, IIoT can help reduce operational costs. This includes savings from improved inventory management, reduced energy usage, and efficient asset utilization.

IIoT provides greater visibility into the entire supply chain. Decision-makers can have a comprehensive view of the supply chain, enabling them to identify issues and opportunities quickly.

Enhanced data and analytics improve risk management by enabling companies to identify and mitigate potential supply chain disruptions more effectively. IIoT facilitates better collaboration and integration among different players in the supply chain, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.
