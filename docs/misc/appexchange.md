AppExchange is Salesforce's online marketplace for third-party applications that integrate with the [[Salesforce]] platform. Launched in 2005, it allows Salesforce users to browse, download, and install applications and integrations developed by other companies and independent software vendors (ISVs) that extend the functionality of Salesforce.

AppExchange hosts a diverse array of applications covering various business needs, including sales, customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and more. The applications on AppExchange can be used to customize and enhance the Salesforce experience, providing additional functionality and integration with other systems.

Applications on AppExchange are typically vetted by Salesforce, ensuring a level of quality and security compliance. Users can review and rate applications, providing feedback and insights for other potential users.

Businesses use AppExchange applications to augment their Salesforce capabilities, tailoring the platform to their specific processes and needs. Many applications offer automation tools for common tasks, improving efficiency. 

Specialized reporting and analytics tools are available to provide deeper insights into business operations. AppExchange includes solutions tailored to specific industries, offering customized tools and workflows.

A real estate company might use Salesforce for customer relationship management. To enhance their capabilities, they could go to AppExchange and find an application specifically designed for real estate businesses, which adds features for property listing management, integration with real estate databases, and advanced analytics for market trends.

Independent software vendors can develop and sell their applications to Salesforce users, reaching a wide audience. Developers can monetize their apps by offering them on AppExchange, either for free or as paid solutions.
