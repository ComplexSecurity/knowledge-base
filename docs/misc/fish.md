GlassFish is an open-source application server project that implements the [[Java]] Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specification. GlassFish provides a server for developing and deploying Java-based web and enterprise applications.

GlassFish is a fully Java EE-compliant application server, meaning it supports all the major Java EE technologies and [[APIs]], such as [[JavaServer Pages (JSP)|JSP]], [[JSF|JSF]], [[Java Persistence API (JPA)|JPA]], [[Java Messaging Service (JMS)|JMS]], [[Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs)|EJB]], [[CDI]], and more. Initially created by Sun Microsystems and later acquired by Oracle Corporation, GlassFish is now an open-source project, allowing developers and organizations to use and contribute to it without cost.

GlassFish provides an administration console (a web-based GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI) for configuring, managing, and monitoring server instances and applications. It is designed for high performance and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale enterprise applications.

GlassFish uses a modular architecture based on the OSGi standard, which allows for dynamic loading and unloading of modules at runtime. GlassFish supports Eclipse MicroProfile, a set of specifications for building microservices-based applications.

It offers a REST interface for administration, allowing remote and programmatic management of the server. GlassFish is integrated with various IDEs, like Eclipse and NetBeans, facilitating development, deployment, and debugging of Java EE applications. The server includes robust security features for authentication, authorization, web services security, and integration with security realms.

[[Payara]] Server is a notable derivative of GlassFish, created to provide a fully-supported version with regular bug fixes and enhancements.
