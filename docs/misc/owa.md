Outlook Web Access is a full-featured,  email client with the look and feel of the Outlook client. With OWA, users can access their mailboxes from any Internet connection regardless of whether or not the computer is equipped with Outlook.

OWA provides most of the same functionality found in Outlook, including the familiar, easy-to-use interface, and the essential tools needed to create a professional email (spell check, signatures, [[HTML]] support and more).

In addition to email, OWA allows users to access their calendars, contacts, tasks and folders through a secure connection, just like they would in the office. Users can also search their old email, set up or edit out of office notifications, manage junk mail settings, and more.

OWA also supports a wide range of file types including Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint slides, PDF files and more. With OWA, users can access these file types even if the program the file is derived from isn’t installed on their computer.

Intermedia hosted Exchange customers can access their mailbox through OWA by navigating to the unified login page, selecting webmail and entering their email address and password.

OWA once applied exclusively to the online version of Outlook which came with Microsoft Exchange Server. These days, Outlook on the web is more commonly accessed from a [[Microsoft 365]] or free Outlook.com account.
