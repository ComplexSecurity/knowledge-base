System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM), part of Microsoft's System Center suite, is a comprehensive management solution for virtualized data center environments. It allows for efficient management of [[Virtual Machines|virtual machine]] (VM) infrastructure and resources across multiple virtualization hosts, including [[Hyper-V]], VMware, and Citrix XenServer environments.

SCVMM provides a central platform to manage virtual machine infrastructure, streamlining tasks such as VM creation, deployment, and maintenance. It supports management of multiple virtualization platforms, including Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware vSphere, and Citrix XenServer, allowing for flexibility and interoperability in virtualized environments.

SCVMM enables rapid deployment of VMs using templates, which can be pre-configured with specific settings, software, and policies. It offers advanced capabilities to manage and optimize virtual networks and storage associated with VMs, including features like dynamic optimization and storage migration.

It facilitates the creation and management of private clouds, providing tools to pool and allocate resources efficiently while maintaining control and compliance. SCVMM integrates with [[Windows PowerShell]], allowing administrators to automate repetitive tasks and customize management operations through scripting.

SCVMM is often used alongside other System Center products like System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) for monitoring, System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) for configuration, and System Center Orchestrator for automation, providing a comprehensive management suite for enterprise IT environments.
