Jakarta EE, formerly known as [[Java]] Platform, Enterprise Edition ([[Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)|Java EE]]), is a set of specifications that extend the [[Java SE (Standard Edition)]] with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services. 

Jakarta EE provides APIs for developing and running scalable, multi-tiered, reliable, and secure network applications. It's now under the stewardship of the Eclipse Foundation. In 2017, Oracle announced the transfer of Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation, and it was rebranded as Jakarta EE. This transition marked a significant shift in the governance and evolution of these enterprise Java standards.

Jakarta EE is used for developing enterprise-level applications, which typically require a large scale, distributed, and multi-tiered architecture. It includes specifications for various enterprise functionalities like web services, database access, messaging, transactions, and more.

With the evolution of cloud computing and microservices, Jakarta EE has adapted to include support for these modern architectural patterns. Jakarta EE applications are built on top of Java SE. It leverages Java SE features and adds additional libraries and frameworks suitable for enterprise applications.

Under the Eclipse Foundation, Jakarta EEâ€™s development is more community-driven, with an open and collaborative approach. Some of the key technologies under Jakarta EE include Jakarta Server Pages (JSP), Jakarta Servlets, Jakarta Messaging, Jakarta RESTful Web Services, and Jakarta Faces, among others.

Jakarta EE applications are typically deployed on compatible application servers like [[Payara]], [[WildFly]] (formerly JBoss), [[TomEE]], and others. The newer versions of Jakarta EE focus on cloud-native development practices, enhancing the capabilities of Jakarta EE for modern cloud environments.
