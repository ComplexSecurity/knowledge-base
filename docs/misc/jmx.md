JMX, which stands for Java Management Extensions, is a [[Java]] technology that provides a standard way to manage and monitor Java applications, system objects, devices, and service-oriented networks. It enables developers and administrators to instrument Java applications and services for monitoring, management, and control purposes. 

JMX defines a set of specifications, [[APIs]], and conventions for managing and monitoring Java applications in a distributed environment. 

MBeans are Java objects that expose management interfaces, attributes, and operations. They encapsulate the management aspects of a resource or application. MBeans can be registered with a management server, making their management interfaces accessible remotely. 

The MBeanServer is a central component that acts as a registry for MBeans. It provides the infrastructure for registering, locating, and managing MBeans. Multiple MBeanServers can coexist in a [[Java virtual machine (JVM)]], allowing for different management domains.

JMX Agents are Java applications or services that act as intermediaries between managed resources (MBeans) and management tools. They host the MBeanServer and facilitate communication between the management tools and the MBeans.

JConsole is a graphical monitoring tool provided by Java SE. It allows administrators and developers to connect to a Java application's MBeanServer and monitor its performance, memory usage, and other runtime attributes. JConsole provides a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring Java applications.

MXBeans are a specialized type of MBean designed for exposing read-only management attributes. They simplify the process of creating MBeans specifically for monitoring purposes. JMX supports a notification mechanism that allows MBeans to send notifications about specific events or changes in their state. This enables asynchronous communication between managed resources and management tools.

JMX Remote enables remote management and monitoring of Java applications. It allows management tools to connect to a remote MBeanServer and interact with MBeans over a network.
