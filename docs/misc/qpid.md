Apache Qpid is an open-source messaging system that implements the [[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)]]. It provides a platform-agnostic framework for messaging between applications and services in distributed systems.

Apache Qpid is designed to adhere to the AMQP standard, which is a messaging protocol that enables communication between applications in a reliable and interoperable manner. It defines the format of messages, the structure of the message broker, and the rules for message routing.

Similar to RabbitMQ, Apache Qpid acts as a message broker, facilitating the exchange of messages between different components of a distributed system. It manages the storage and routing of messages between producers and consumers. Apache Qpid uses message queues to store and manage messages. Producers send messages to queues, and consumers retrieve messages from the queues. This decouples the communication between components, enabling asynchronous and scalable interactions.

Apache Qpid supports different exchange types, including direct, fanout, topic, and headers exchanges. These exchanges determine how messages are routed to queues based on criteria such as routing keys. Messages in Apache Qpid are published with routing keys. These keys are used by exchanges to determine the destination queues for the messages.

Apache Qpid allows the declaration of durable queues and exchanges. Durable entities survive broker restarts, ensuring that important messages are not lost. Messages in Apache Qpid can be marked as persistent, meaning they are stored on disk. This ensures that messages survive broker restarts or failures.

Apache Qpid provides support for [[JMS]], a [[Java]]-based messaging API. This allows Java applications to interact with Qpid using the standard JMS interfaces. Apache Qpid can be integrated with [[Apache Camel]], a versatile open-source integration framework. This integration allows for the seamless exchange of messages between different systems and protocols.

Apache Qpid supports clustering to achieve high availability. Clusters consist of multiple broker nodes, and if one node fails, others can continue processing messages. Apache Qpid provides tools for managing and monitoring the message broker. This includes features for configuring queues and exchanges, monitoring message flows, and tracking performance metrics.
