A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a type of hosting service that provides users with a [[Virtual Machines|virtual machine]] running its own copy of an operating system (OS). This service gives customers superuser-level access to that operating system instance, allowing them to install almost any software that runs on that OS. Essentially, a VPS operates like a dedicated physical server but is actually a virtualized instance within a larger physical server.

Each VPS is isolated from others on the same physical server, ensuring that the actions or traffic of one user do not affect others. Users have root or administrative access, allowing for extensive customization, software installations, and configuration adjustments. VPS hosting can typically be scaled to accommodate changing needs in resources like CPU, RAM, and disk space.

VPS offers many of the benefits of a dedicated server at a lower cost, as the physical server's resources are shared among multiple users. Unlike shared hosting, a VPS provides dedicated portions of the server's resources, including CPU time, memory, and storage space.

While VPS services are legitimate and widely used for hosting websites, running applications, and other IT needs, they can also be related to hacking in various ways:

Malicious actors may use VPSs to host [[phishing]] sites, control panels for malware, or other illicit web services, taking advantage of the VPS's resources and relative anonymity. Ethical hackers and security researchers often use VPSs to legally conduct penetration testing or vulnerability assessments, providing a controlled and isolated environment for testing.

Hackers may use VPSs, especially those located in different countries, to mask their location and identity, making it harder to trace malicious activities back to them. VPSs can be used to host [[Command and Control (C2)|command and control (C&C)]] servers for botnets, benefiting from their stable internet connection, uptime, and processing power.

Users are responsible for securing their VPS. This includes regular updates, firewall configuration, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access. VPS providers typically monitor for and take action against abusive behavior on their networks, but the level of monitoring and enforcement can vary.
