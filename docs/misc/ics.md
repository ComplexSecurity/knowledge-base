  
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are systems used to control industrial processes such as manufacturing, product handling, power generation, fabrication, and refining. They are designed to operate and manage machinery and processes in industrial settings, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and safety. 

ICS encompasses various types of control systems, including [[Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)]] systems, [[Distributed Control Systems (DCS)]], and [[Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC)]].

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to monitor and control industrial, infrastructure, or facility-based processes. For example, a SCADA system might be used to monitor and regulate the water flow in a municipal water supply system, overseeing the various pumps and valves in the system, and ensuring the proper distribution of water.

DCS are used in manufacturing processes that are continuous or batch-oriented. An example of DCS is in a chemical plant where the production process needs precise control and coordination across various parts of the plant.

PLCs are used for the automation of industrial electromechanical processes. For instance, a PLC might be used in a car manufacturing plant to control the robotic arms used in the assembly line.

ICS automate industrial processes, increasing efficiency and consistency in production. They enable real-time monitoring and control of industrial environments, improving the safety, performance, and reliability of these systems. ICS systems gather critical data from industrial environments, aiding in decision-making and process optimization.

With the increasing connectivity of ICS to the internet and other networks for remote monitoring and control (part of the broader trend towards the [[Industrial IoT (IIoT)|Industrial Internet of Things]] or IIoT), these systems have become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such attacks can disrupt industrial operations, cause physical damage, or lead to safety hazards.

Ensuring the cybersecurity of ICS is a growing concern and requires specialized knowledge of both cybersecurity and industrial processes.
