XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a language for transforming [[Extensible Markup Language]] documents into other XML documents, or other formats such as [[HTML]] for web pages, plain text, or even [[XSL-FO (Formatting Objects)]] for PDF creation.

It is part of the [[XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language)]] family of technologies defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

XSLT is designed to transform the structure and appearance of XML data. It allows one XML document to be transformed into another XML document that has a different structure, or into a different format entirely.

XSLT uses a template-based approach. An XSLT stylesheet consists of templates that match specific XML elements or attributes, and these templates define how the matched content should be transformed and formatted.

The transformation is performed by an XSLT processor, which reads the XML and XSLT files, and then generates the output. This output can be another XML document, HTML, text, or other formats, depending on the transformation instructions.

XSLT heavily relies on [[XPath]] (XML Path Language) for navigating XML documents and selecting nodes, which are pieces of data in the XML document that the XSLT transforms. Common use cases for XSLT include web page rendering from XML data, creating PDF documents from XML data, and converting XML data to different XML schemas.
