IBM WebSphere refers to a brand of IBM software products, primarily focused on creating and managing web and enterprise applications. WebSphere is known for its robust performance in business-critical and complex transactional environments. The brand includes a range of products, but the most recognized among them is the IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS). 

WAS is a [[Java]]-based application server platform that allows businesses to build and run highly available, scalable, and secure applications. It supports Java EE (Enterprise Edition) and web services standards.

WAS provides a runtime environment for enterprise applications and supports various services, including transaction management, messaging, clustering, workload management, and performance monitoring.

WebSphere products are often used in middleware roles, facilitating communication and integration between different applications across diverse computing environments. IBM WebSphere also includes portal solutions, enabling the development of personalized web portals, which integrate applications and content into a single, user-friendly interface.

WebSphere products support SOA, an architectural pattern in software design where services are provided to other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. Designed for enterprise environments, WebSphere offers high performance, scalability, and reliability for handling complex business transactions and processes.

 Security is a key aspect, with WebSphere providing robust authentication, authorization, and encryption capabilities. Formerly known as MQSeries, IBM WebSphere MQ is a messaging middleware product that allows independent and potentially non-concurrent applications on a distributed system to securely communicate with each other.
 
WebSphere is typically used by large enterprises in industries like banking, finance, healthcare, and retail, where high-volume transactions and reliability are crucial.
