gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) is an open-source, high-performance RPC ([[Remote Procedure Call]]) framework initially developed by Google. 

It uses [[HTTP2|HTTP/2]] for transport, [[Protocol Buffers]] as the interface description language, and provides features like authentication, [[Load Balancer|load balancing]], and more. gRPC enables efficient communication between services in different languages by generating client and server code from .proto files. 

It's known for its efficiency in connecting services in microservices architectures, especially when low latency and high throughput are required. gRPC supports bi-directional streaming, providing advantages over traditional [[REST APIs]] in certain scenarios, particularly where real-time updates and high-performance communication are essential.
