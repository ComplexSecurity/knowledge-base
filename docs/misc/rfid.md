Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology used to identify and track tags attached to objects. It uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags containing electronically stored information.

An RFID system typically includes RFID tags, RFID readers, and an antenna. RFID tags contain an integrated circuit and an antenna to transmit data to the RFID reader. The reader then converts the radio waves to a more usable form of data.

RFID tags can be either passive or active. Passive tags do not have their own power source; they receive energy from the reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have their own power source, usually a battery, and can transmit data over longer distances.

RFID operates at several different frequencies, each with its own set of applications. Low-frequency (LF) RFID systems, high-frequency (HF) systems, including [[Near Field Communication (NFC)|NFC]] (Near Field Communication), and ultra-high-frequency (UHF) systems are the most common.

RFID tags store data and transmit it to the reader. This data can include identification numbers, location information, or specifics about the product to which the tag is attached.

RFID is used in a wide range of applications, including supply chain management, retail inventory tracking, access control (like keycards), identification (like pet microchips), and contactless payment systems.

Unlike barcodes, RFID does not require line-of-sight to read tags. Multiple tags can be read simultaneously and from a greater distance, which significantly speeds up the scanning process.

RFID poses unique security and privacy challenges, as tags can be read without the knowledge of the tag holder. Encryption and authentication methods are used to enhance security.

RFID data can be integrated with other systems like [[Enterprise Resource Planning Applications|enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems for better data analysis and utilization.
