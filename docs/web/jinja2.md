Jinja2 is a popular and powerful template engine for [[Python]] web applications. It is used to generate dynamic content in web pages and other text-based documents. Jinja2 is widely used in web frameworks like [[Flask]] and [[Django]], as well as other Python applications where templating is needed.

Jinja2 uses a template syntax that allows the embedding of dynamic content within static templates. Jinja2 also supports template inheritance, which allows you to define a base template and then create child templates.

For security, Jinja2 automatically escapes content by default to prevent [[Cross-Site Scripting]] attacks.
