Sass (**Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets**) is an extension of [[CSS]]. Style sheet languages control where and how text appears on a webpage, from frame size and colour to menu positions.

CSS is used all over the web, but that doesn’t make it the smoothest coding experience. It was designed to help developers write instructions on how to present text on a screen rather than to work with variables or perform complex decision-making tasks.

Sass is a preprocessor language that’s interpreted into CSS. A preprocessor language takes input data and converts it to an output that’s used as input by another program.

This means when you run Sass code, you’re actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser.
