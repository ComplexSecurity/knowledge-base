HyperText Markup Language is the language used to create web pages. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure and display content on a webpage. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements such as tags and attributes.

HTML documents are files that end with a **.html** or **.htm** extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.

All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element.

The three main parts of an element are: 

- Opening tag - used to state where an element starts to take effect
- Content - the output that other users see
- Closing tag - same as opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name

Another critical part of an HTML element is its attribute, which has two sections – a **name** and **attribute value**. The name identifies the additional information that a user wants to add, while the attribute value gives further specifications.
