Mako is a lightweight and fast templating engine for [[Python]]. It is designed to provide a simple and expressive syntax for dynamic content generation in web applications and other Python projects. Mako templates are typically used to embed dynamic content within [[HTML]], [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]], or other text-based files.

Mako templates use a Python-like syntax, making it easy for Python developers to create dynamic content without learning a new templating language. The template syntax is designed to be familiar and expressive.

Mako templates support the insertion of dynamic content, variables, and expressions directly into the template. This allows developers to generate HTML or other text-based content dynamically based on variables or data retrieved from the application.

Mako supports template inheritance, allowing developers to create a base template with common structure and sections. Subsequent templates can then extend or override specific sections of the base template. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.

Mako provides filters and macros that can be applied to content within templates. Filters allow developers to modify or format content, while macros enable the creation of reusable template components.

Mako is known for its performance and efficiency. It compiles templates into Python code, and the compiled code can be cached for faster execution. This makes Mako suitable for high-performance web applications.

Mako can be easily integrated with various Python web frameworks, such as Pyramid and [[Flask]]. It allows developers to use Mako templates seamlessly within the context of web applications.

An example Mako template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>${title}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>${heading}</h1>
    <ul>
        % for item in items:
            <li>${item}</li>
        % endfor
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, `${...}` syntax is used for variable interpolation, and `%...%` is used for control structures like loops. The Mako template allows dynamic generation of HTML content based on variables such as `title`, `heading`, and `items`.
