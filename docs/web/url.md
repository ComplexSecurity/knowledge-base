A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the address of a resource on the Internet and the protocol used to access it.

It indicates the location of a web resource like a street address indicates where a person lives physically — because of this, an URL is often referred to as “**web address**”.

A URL contains the following information:

- The protocol used to access the resource.
- The location of the [[server]] (whether by IP address or domain name).
- The [[port]] number on the server (optional).
- The location of the resource in the directory structure of the server.
- A fragment identifier (optional).

!!! info
A URL is a type of uniform resource identifier (URI). In common practice, the term URI isn’t used, or is used synonymously with URL, even though this is technically incorrect.
