The `PUT` [[HTTP Verbs|HTTP method]] is used in web development as part of the [[HTTP protocol]] to update or replace the resource identified by a specific URL. It's one of the methods defined by the HTTP/1.1 specification and is commonly utilized in [[REST APIs|RESTful APIs]] and web services for modifying existing resources.

`PUT` requests are used to send data to the server to update or replace the resource at the specified URL. `PUT` is idempotent, meaning that making multiple identical `PUT` requests has the same effect as making a single request. The data to be updated or replaced is typically included in the body of the `PUT` request.

If proper authentication and authorization controls are not in place, an attacker might exploit the `PUT` method to modify content or data. For instance, without adequate security checks, an attacker could send a `PUT` request to modify sensitive data or configuration files.

Insecurely implemented `PUT` requests can lead to data integrity issues, where critical information is altered or overwritten unintentionally or maliciously. Like other HTTP methods, the data included in `PUT` requests should be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, such as [[SQL injection]], and to ensure that the data conforms to expected formats.
