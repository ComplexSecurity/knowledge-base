Web configuration testing in cybersecurity is the practice of examining and verifying the settings and setup of a web application and its hosting environment to identify and fix security weaknesses.

This involves checking how the web [[Server|servers]], [[Databases (KB)]], and other components in the application's ecosystem are configured to ensure they don't have vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.

The goal is to ensure that every aspect of the web application's deployment is secure and doesn't leave any gaps for potential security breaches.
