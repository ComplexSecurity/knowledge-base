A cookieÂ is a piece of data from a website that is stored within a web browser that the website can retrieve at a later time. Cookies are used to tell the server that users have returned to a particular website. When users return to a website, a cookie provides information and allows the site to display selected settings and targeted content.

Cookies also store information such as shopping cart contents, registration or login credentials, and user preferences. This is done so that when users revisit sites, any information that was provided in a previous session or any set preferences can be easily retrieved.

Advertisers use cookies to track user activity across sites so they can better target ads. While this particular practice is usually offered to provide a more personalized user experience, some people also view this as a privacy concern.

Cookies are intended to be use for session management, personalization and tracking.

There are many types of cookies including:

- **Session cookies** - store information while the user is visiting the website, deleted once the user closes the session
- **Persistent cookie** - stored for specific length of time, remain on device until expire or deleted
- **First-party and third-party cookies** - set by sites that users directly visit, often store information relevant or related to the site (settings, location, etc..)
- **Supercookies** - similiar to session cookies but can re-create user profiles, even after deletion. Stored in different places.
- **Flash cookies** - data files stored on computers by sites that use Adobe Flash
