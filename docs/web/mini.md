JavaScript minification is a process used to optimize [[JavaScript]] files for web applications. The primary goal is to reduce the file size, which in turn speeds up page loading times. Minification involves several key steps:

1. **Removing Unnecessary Characters**: This includes spaces, new lines, comments, and block delimiters which are not required for the JavaScript to execute.
2. **Renaming Variables and Functions**: Shorter names are substituted for original ones. For example, a variable named userEmailAddress might be shortened to a.
3. **Shortening Function and Variable Declarations**: This can include converting function declarations into shorter, anonymous functions.
4. **Optimizing Code Structure and Statements**: This might include simplifying loops and conditionals or using shorter syntax where possible.
5. **Removing Dead Code**: Any code that is not used or is unreachable is removed.
