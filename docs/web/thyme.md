  
Thymeleaf is a modern server-side [[Java]] [[Template Engines|template engine]] for web and standalone environments. It is used for dynamic web content generation and is particularly well-suited for integration with Java web applications. Thymeleaf follows a natural templating approach where templates are designed to be human-readable and can be used both as static prototypes and dynamic templates.

Thymeleaf templates are designed to be easily readable by humans, making them suitable for use as static prototypes. This helps front-end and back-end developers collaborate effectively. Thymeleaf seamlessly integrates with Java frameworks, making it a popular choice for Java-based web applications. It supports integration with [[Spring Framework]], [[Spring Boot]], and other Java frameworks.

Thymeleaf performs server-side rendering, generating [[HTML]] on the server before sending it to the client. This approach is suitable for web applications that rely on dynamic content generation on the server side.

Thymeleaf uses its own expression language (Thymeleaf Standard Expression or simply Thymeleaf expressions) for dynamic content binding. These expressions are written within HTML tags and allow for easy integration with Java objects.

Example:

```html
<p>Hello, <span th:text="${user.name}">User</span>!</p>
```

Thymeleaf supports the creation of reusable template fragments and layouts, promoting code modularity and reusability.

Example (Fragment):

```html
<!-- Fragment: header.html -->
<header>
    <h1>Website Title</h1>
</header>
```

Example (Layout):

```html
<!-- Layout: layout.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Layout Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div th:replace="fragments/header :: header"></div>
    <div th:replace="content"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

Thymeleaf supports conditional processing and iteration over collections, allowing developers to create dynamic content based on business logic.

Example:

```html
<ul>
    <li th:each="item : ${items}" th:text="${item}">Item</li>
</ul>
```

Thymeleaf provides features for handling internationalization and localization of content, making it suitable for multi-language applications. Thymeleaf is an open-source project that has gained popularity due to its simplicity, versatility, and ease of integration with Java-based web frameworks. It is widely used in enterprise-level Java web applications.
