Joomla is an open source [content management system](../web/cms.md). It helps you build powerful dynamic websites and applications. It has an intuitive interface that helps you use its features and functionality to the fullest.

Joomla is written in PHP and use MySQL database to store the data while using object-oriented programming techniques. It can be set up with one-click install through web hosting control panel. 

Joomla uses **Model-View-Controller** (MVC) design architecture. According to the MVC pattern when Joomla process a request, it first analyzes the URL to evaluate which component will process the request. The model contains the data used by the component. 

It is also the Model’s responsibility to update the database when and where required. The view is accountable for producing the output. It can contact with the model to get the needed information. After the view has produced the output, the component gives back the control to the Joomla framework which then executes the template.
