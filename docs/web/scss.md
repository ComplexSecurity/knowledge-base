The term SCSS is an acronym for **Sassy Cascading Style Sheets**. It is basically a more advanced and evolved variant of the [[CSS]] language. It comes with more advanced features- thus often called Sassy CSS. This language is a preprocessor one, and we need to compile or interrupt it into the CSS language. The SCSS language comes with a file extension, namely .scss.

SCSS assists a user in adding various extra features to the CSS, such as nesting, variables, etc. These extra features make the process of writing the SCSS language quicker and easier as compared to that of writing the standard language of CSS. The SCSS language may make use of the CSS function and code. The SCSS stays totally compliant with the syntax of CSS- and it also supports the full power of the [[SASS]].
