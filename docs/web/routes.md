In the context of web applications, "web routes" or "routing" refers to the mechanism that maps incoming [[HTTP Protocol|HTTP]] requests to specific handlers based on their URL patterns. It's a crucial aspect of modern web application design, as it directs user requests to the appropriate content or functionality.

Routes determine how an application responds to a client request for a specific endpoint, which is a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URI]] (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). Each route can be associated with a specific function or controller action in the application, which handles the request and returns the appropriate response.

Most modern web frameworks (like [[Express|Express.js]] in [[NodeJS|Node.js]], [[Django]] in [[Python]], [[Laravel]] in [[PHP]], and [[Ruby on Rails]]) have built-in routing capabilities. They allow developers to easily define routes in a structured and readable way.

In [[REST APIs|RESTful]] web services, routes are often designed to correspond to resource-based paths. For example, `GET /articles` might retrieve a list of articles, while `POST /articles` might create a new article. This approach aligns with the REST architecture's principles, which emphasize scalability, statelessness, and a uniform interface.

Dynamic and Static Routes:

- **Static Routes**: Fixed and do not change, e.g., `/about` or `/contact`.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Include variable path segments that can change, e.g., `/users/:userId/posts/:postId`, where `:userId` and `:postId` are variables.

In [[Single Page Application (SPA) Routing|SPAs]] (like those built with [[AngularJS|Angular]], [[ReactJS|React]], or [[Vue.js|Vue]]), routing is often handled on the client-side to dynamically load and display content without requiring a full page reload. Well-defined routes contribute to better Search Engine Optimization (SEO), as they allow for clear, descriptive URLs.

Routing also involves handling invalid paths or errors, typically through '404 Not Found' or '500 Internal Server Error' routes. In the [[Model-View-Controller (MVC)|MVC (Model-View-Controller)]] pattern, routes play a crucial role in connecting the Controller layer (handling logic) to specific URLs.
