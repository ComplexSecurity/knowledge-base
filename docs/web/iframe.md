An iframe, short for inline frame, is an [[HTML]] element used to embed another HTML document within a webpage. It's like a window within a webpage that displays content from another webpage.

They are commonly used to embed specific content like external ads, videos, tags, or other interactive elements into the page.

The \<iframe> tag is easy to implement and supports various attributes like src, width, and height. While iframes are useful for content separation and embedding diverse types of content, they also pose potential security risks and can impact website performance and SEO. 

Browsers apply the [[same origin policy]] to iframes for security, restricting access between the parent page and the iframe content from different domains. [[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)]] and mechanisms like the postMessage API are used to enable safe cross-domain communications in modern web development.
