A [[proxy]] server is a web server that acts as a gateway between a [[client]] application, for example, a browser, and the real [[server]]. It makes requests to the real server on behalf of the client or sometimes fulfils the claim itself.

Web proxy servers have two primary purposes, namely to **filter requests** and **improve performances**. Additionally, there are proxy servers that sit between web servers and web clients known as a reverse proxy.

[[Reverse proxy]] servers pass on requests from web clients to web servers. They are used to cache images and pages to reduce the load on web servers significantly.
