Subdomains are subdivisions or extensions of a primary domain in the [[DNS|domain name system]] (DNS) hierarchy. They are used to organize and navigate different sections of a website and can represent different services, products, or functions of the main website. Essentially, a subdomain is a way to create a separate website area without needing to register a new domain name.

Subdomains are the part of a domain that comes before the main domain name and domain extension. They can help you organize your website. For example, docs.google.com. In this URL, "**docs**" is the subdomain.

Subdomains function as a separate website from its domain. This distinction enables you to develop a section of your website without muddling your site’s overall intent.
