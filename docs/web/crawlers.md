Search engine crawlers, also known as web crawlers, spiders, or spider-bots, are internet bots used by search engines to update their content or index. These crawlers are essential for search engines to gather information about various websites and pages on the internet, which enables them to provide relevant and updated search results to users.

Crawlers start by visiting a set of web pages. They then follow the links on these pages, essentially "crawling" from one page to another. This process allows them to find new pages and add them to the list of sites to index.

As they visit these pages, crawlers read and process the content of the pages (like text, images, video file links, and other media). They catalog this information and send it back to the search engine.  The search engine processes this data and updates its index â€“ the database used for generating search results.

Content that changes frequently or is generated based on user interactions can be challenging for crawlers to index effectively. The "crawl budget" is the number of pages a crawler will index on a site in a given timeframe. Websites with a vast number of pages may not have all their content indexed if the crawl budget is exceeded.

Crawlers must follow rules set by website owners in [[Robots.txt|robots.txt]] files, which can restrict or guide their crawling activities.

Understanding how crawlers work is crucial for SEO. Website designers and owners aim to make their sites crawler-friendly to ensure better indexing and higher rankings in search engine results.
