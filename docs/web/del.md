The `DELETE` [[HTTP Verbs|HTTP method]] is used in web development as part of the [[HTTP protocol]] to request the removal of a specific resource identified by a URL. It's one of the methods defined by the HTTP/1.1 specification and is commonly used in [[REST APIs|RESTful APIs]] and web services.

The primary purpose of the `DELETE` method is to request that the server delete the resource located at the specified URL. Like `GET` and `PUT` methods, `DELETE` is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.

When a server receives a `DELETE` request, it deletes the resource and usually returns a status code indicating the outcome (e.g., `200 OK` for successful deletion, `404 Not Found` if the resource doesnâ€™t exist, etc.).

If access controls are not properly implemented, an attacker might exploit the `DELETE` method to remove critical data or resources. For instance, without proper authorization checks, an attacker could send a `DELETE` request to a URL like `http://example.com/user/123` and potentially delete user data.

Insecure implementation of the `DELETE` method could lead to accidental or intentional data loss, impacting the integrity and availability of the application's data. Like other HTTP methods, inputs (such as URL parameters) in `DELETE` requests should be validated to prevent injection attacks or unintended actions.
