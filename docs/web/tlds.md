In the [[DNS]] hierarchy, a top-level domain (TLD) represents the first stop after the root zone. In simpler terms, a TLD is everything that follows the final dot of a domain. For example, in the domain name ‘google.com’, ‘**.com**’ is the TLD.

    Some other popular TLDs include ‘.org’, ‘.uk’, and ‘.edu’.

There are 5 official types of TLDs:

3. **Country Code Top-level Domains** (ccTLD) - used for specific countries and territories (us, es, co.uk, ch, ca)
4. **Infrastructure Top-Level Domain** (ARPA) - only one TLD (ARPA), managed by IANA used for technical web infrastructure purposes.
5. **Test Top-Level Domains** (tTLD) - reserved for documentation purposes and local testing (example, invalid, localhost, test)
