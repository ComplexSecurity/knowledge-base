Twig is a [[Template Engines|template engine]] for the [[PHP]] programming language. It is a flexible and powerful templating language that allows developers to embed dynamic content into their [[HTML]], [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]], or other markup languages. Twig was created by the developers of the [[Symfony]] web framework but can be used independently of Symfony in any PHP project.

Twig uses a clean and readable syntax, making it easy for developers to understand and maintain templates. Twig has built-in security features to help prevent common security vulnerabilities such as [[cross-site scripting]] (XSS) attacks. It automatically escapes output by default, which helps to avoid the injection of malicious code.

Twig is extensible, allowing developers to define their own custom tags, filters, and functions, making it adaptable to various project requirements. Twig supports template inheritance, allowing developers to create a base template and extend or override specific blocks in child templates. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.

Twig provides control structures like loops, conditions, and iterators, enabling developers to implement logic within templates. Twig includes a variety of built-in filters and functions for manipulating data and formatting output. Additionally, developers can create custom filters and functions as needed.

While Twig can be used independently, it is closely associated with the Symfony framework. Symfony uses Twig as its default templating engine. A simple example of Twig syntax may be:

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ page_title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{ user.name }}!</h1>

    {% if user.isAdmin %}
        <p>Welcome, Administrator!</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>Welcome, regular user!</p>
    {% endif %}
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, `{{ page_title }}`, `{{ user.name }}`, and `{% if user.isAdmin %}` are examples of Twig syntax for printing variables and implementing control structures. Twig templates are processed on the server side, and the resulting HTML is sent to the client.
